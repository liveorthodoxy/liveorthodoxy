  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It’s interesting for me to look at the world around me as we approach the Great Feasts and note how so few people I know observe these Feasts of the Christian faith (save Christmas and, for some, Easter). Growing up, I had never really heard of the Feast of Pentecost as a Christian celebration, it was a foreign concept to me after I joined the Church and now it serves as one of my favorite feasts of the year.  Of course I had read about Pentecost, growing up Charismatic, Acts 2 was a very popular read, but I didn’t really know that it was celebrated throughout the Christian world much as Christmas had been, and the Jewish feasts of the Old Testament. I grew up Charismatic so Pentecost was a defense for speaking in tongues (not an issue I’m going to delve into, suffice to say, my interpretation of this is dramatically different now), but it’s place as an actual feast recognized every year 50 days after Pascha (Easter) was not there, so I thought I’d share a little on the traditional understanding of the Feast of Pentecost.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-pentecost">The History of Pentecost</h2>

<p>From the Old Testament, Pentecost, which means 50th day, was an agricultural feast that occurred 50 days after Pascha (Passover) and is known by the Jewish faithful as the Feast of the First Fruits, or Shavuot. While an agricultural feast (the end of the harvest season), it is also associated with God giving Moses the 10 Commandments on Mount Sinai. For Christians, Pentecost is the beginning of the ministry of the Apostles. In the upper room, the Apostles (and Mary) sat faithfully waiting as Christ had commanded the arrival of the Holy Spirit. This time, when God meets man, instead of bringing stone tablets written with fire, the fire rested upon the heads of the Holy Apostles and they preached Christ to all who were present. Mount Sinai and the tablets given to Moses foreshadowed what was now fulfilled with the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-pentecost">Why Do We Need Pentecost</h2>

<p>We as Christians also see this as a reversal of the Tower of Babel. People decided that they were not content to rule over the earth, but pride led them to want to acquire heaven by force. They built a tower to reach God and, in turn, God confused the tongues of man. On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit unites humanity together again by the gift of tongues. The hymnography of the Church clearly illustrates this: Of old there was confusion of tongues because of the boldness of the tower-builders. But those tongues have not uttered wisdom for the glory of divine knowledge. There God condemned the infidels to punishment, and here with the Spirit Christ illuminated the fishermen. At that time, the confusion of tongues was designed for vengeance, and now the unison of tongues hath been renewed for the salvation of our souls. – the Doxasticon of Pentecost When the High One descended, confusing tongues, He divided the nations. And when He distributed the fiery tongues He called all to one unity. Wherefore, in unison we glorify the most Holy Spirit. – the Kontakion of Pentecost. As <a href="Archbishop +DMITRI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_Dmitri_Royster</a> (memory eternal) wrote in his <a href="article on Pentecost">http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/62291.htm</a>: “What happened on that fiftieth day after our Lord’s resurrection was the filling of the disciples with the Holy Spirit, their transformation into the Church. Pentecost is the day of the Church’s founding. From this point in time the disciples were empowered to do what our Lord told them: ‘As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.’” (John 20:21). Pentecost Icon And at Orthros we sing: The spring of the Spirit hath come to those on earth, dividing noetically into fire-bearing rivers, moistening the Apostles and illuminating them. The fire hath become to them a dewy cloud, lighting, and raining flames upon them, from whom we received grace by the fire and the water. Verily the fire of the Comforter hath come and lighted the world. In the Orthodox Church, we switch all of the liturgical colors (vestments, altar cloths, candles, etc) from the joyous white of Pascha, to a green, clearly connecting to the Jewish celebration of Pentecost, as its fulfillment.</p>

<h2 id="pentecost-in-the-life-of-the-church">Pentecost in the Life of the Church</h2>

<p>Pentecost is the third of the “Big Three” feasts if you will: on Christmas, God becomes incarnate, humbles Himself takes on humanity with the intent of redeeming creation; on Pascha, God defeats the ultimate enemy of death for us, defeating death by death and restoring humanity to it’s original state through His glorious resurrection; on Pentecost, the third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit descends and gives us what we as followers of Christ need to become perfect. <a href="Fr. Anthony Coniaris">http://www.stmarysgoc.org/fr-anthony-coniaris/</a> quotes St. Seraphim of Sarov in his article How To Celebrate Pentecost at Home by saying : <em>“Prayer, fasting, vigils and all other Christian acts, however good they may be in themselves, certainly do not constitute the aim of our Christian life; they are but the indispensable means of attaining that aim. For the true aim of the Christian life is the acquisition of the Holy Spirit of God. As for fasts, vigils, prayer and almsgiving, and other good works done in the name of Christ, they are only the means of acquiring the Holy Spirit of God.”</em> So, “Let us, O believers, celebrate with joy the last Feast, which is also the last of the Feast—Pentecost—which is the end and fulfillment of the preordained promise; for then did come down the fire of the Comforter upon the earth in the likeness of tongues, lighting the Disciples and revealing them plainly as initiates of heavenly things. Verily, the light of the Comforter hath come and lighted the world” – Kathismata from Orthros. With that in mind, let us begin again to pray: O heavenly King, the Comforter, Spirit of Truth, Who art in all places, and fillest all things, Treasury of good things, and Giver of life, come, and dwell in us, and cleanse us from every stain; and save our souls, O good One.</p>

<p><em>I’ve wanted to write a listicle about the Orthodox Church, my home within Christianity, for quite some time. But, as often happens, I got distracted and never finished it, until today. So what changed? I saw an <a href="http://benirwin.me/2015/01/22/11-things-about-the-episcopal-church/">article</a> shared by my friend <a href="http://audreyeclectic.blogspot.com/">Heather</a> about the 11 things someone loves about the Episcopal Church. It inspired me to write this, not as a rebuttal or a “We’re better than you,” but to share some of what in Orthodoxy keeps me connected to Christ, to the Church and to my brothers and sisters in Christ. That being said, thank you Ben and Heather for the inspiration and I hope I can do justice to the beauty of Orthodoxy.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-journey-to-orthodoxy">My Journey to Orthodoxy</h2>

<p>I joined the Orthodox Church almost 14 years ago after feeling lost within the Charismatic/Evangelical world. I was attending Oral Roberts University and had way too many questions to know where to start. I had begun studying some Church History and was at a point where I was torn between Catholocism and Anglicanism, not feeling terribly comfortable with either option and my roommate was considering Messianic Judaism. The two of us were longing for something we couldn’t find and got to a point when we got a $1 loaf of french bread and bottle of grape juice to have communion in our room because we didn’t really know where we belonged.</p>

<p>Then one night, I was in someone’s dorm and saw a copy of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Eastern_Orthodox_Christianity.html?id=2B8lAQAAIAAJ">Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective</a> on his table. While I don’t recommend the book, it was enough to get me asking what Orthodox was. I did some research online, ordered a ton of books, and got everything I could from the library. The more I read, the more I felt at peace about things I’d been questioning. I prayerfully read, started attending <a href="http://www.stanontytulsa.com">my parish</a> here in town and was chrismated into the Church and I’ve never looked back. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-to-figure-it-all-out">1. I don’t have to figure it all out.</h2>

<p>On Sunday mornings, when Fr. George begins to preach his homily, I listen and take what he teaches as spiritual food and edification. I do the same thing no matter which parish I visit because priests are connected to the Apostolic Tradition. They don’t spend time trying to think up new doctrine or theological opinions, because they participate in the continuation of the preaching and teaching (the kyrgma) of the Apostles.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy--orthopraxis-go-hand-in-hand">2. Orthodoxy &amp; Orthopraxis go hand in hand</h2>

<p>The holy apostles taught us to “hold fast to the traditions “</p>

<h2 id="we-worship-with-our-whole-being">4. We worship with our whole being</h2>

<p>Orthodox worship engages all of the senses, taking worship about of a theoretical place, and grounding it here, in something tangible. We cross ourselves, offer metenias, prostrate, process - all forms of worship involving movement, engaging our bodies. As we look around, we are surrounded by the icons of Christ and His saints, we hear the chanting and the bells, we smell the incense, we taste the fountain of immortality in the Eucharist - our whole person is engaged in worship, as it should be because, afterall, when God created us He said, “It is good.”</p>

<p>Our senses engaged in worship speaks to our view of humankind - we are not evil. Our bodies are not evil. We weren’t created to die, the seperation of body and soul is a consequence of the fall, not part of God’s design. Our free will seperates us, but it was Christ’s incarnation, a good and loving Christ who put on humanity, that redeemed the material world.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-is-connected">5. Orthodoxy is connected</h2>

<p>When I go to an Orthodox Church, I know what to expect. Every Orthodox Church, throughout the entire world will be participating in the same liturgy I am. I am part of something much larger, part of communities of people I’ve never met with languages and cultural customs I know nothing about. A few years ago, I visited a Serbian parish that was near my parents. I <em>should</em> have done my research, but I didn’t and when I got there the entire liturgy was in Serbian. Despite the fact that I obviously don’t understand more than a couple of Serbian words, I was actively involed in the liturgy. I knew what the priest was saying, I knew what the chanters were chanting and I was able to participate in this glorious service, commune and fellowship with my brothers and sisters in Christ after service.</p>

<p>But the connection is deeper - as I look at the icons on the walls, I am connected with those saints. I am praying the same prayers they prayed, I am singing the same hymns they sang, I am receiving the same Eucharist they received. We are connected as the Church militant in a very real way to the Church invisible because,  <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews+12/">“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-begin-or-end-liturgy-we-merely-join-in">6. We don’t begin or end liturgy, we merely join in</h2>

<p>The Bible shows us insights into Heaven. We see</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-embraces-mystery">7. Orthodoxy embraces Mystery.</h2>
<p>As an Orthodox Christian, I don’t have to try to explain everything. I know that God is bigger than I am and that my ways truly are not His ways.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-and-individual-worship-is-a-part-of-the-christian-life">8. Corporate and Individual Worship is a part of the Christian life</h2>
<p>Orthodox Churches are all laid out the same - we walk into the narthex, enter into the nave and face the altar. The nave is like a ship,</p>

<h2 id="confession-is-freeing">9. Confession is freeing.</h2>
<p>I have a spiritual father, not just a priest, but someone who knows me inside and out, all of my deepest darkest secrets who helps me navigate through the Christian life. After I’ve prayerfully prepared for Confession, I go to our parish and stand with my priest before the icon of Christ at the front of our parish. As I confess, I make my confession to Christ and sometimes I’m granted the freeing tears of repentence. Once I’ve finished, Fr. George confirms Christ’s forgiveness and the remission of sins. But that’s not all, he counsels me with spiritual wisdom that helps me grow in Christ. The Church, through confession, helps us to rise up and become who we are supposed to be in Christ. We are conformed to the image and likeness of Christ. After I confess, I feel free. The sins that I’ve committed, both out in the open and those that I think have been done in secret, once confessed, lose their hold on me. I no longer feel the weight of guilt, but instead know that I can be more than who I am.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgcial-calendar">10. The Liturgcial Calendar</h2>
<p>I always loved Christmas - the decorations, the Christmas music we sang in Church, the reading of the Nativity story. Now I love the rest of the events in Christ’s life, along with the events of the Early Church as well lives of the Theotokos and saints and major events in the life of the Church throughout history. The Israelites remembered important days in which God intervened and helped them as Feast Days, days Christ and the Apostles kept.</p>

<p>We just celebrated Pascha (Easter) a few weeks ago and every day, we remember that we are in the Paschal season: I find myself sing the Paschal troparion <em>Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!</em> and the Paschal antiphons, I greet other members of the Church by saying <em>“Christ is Risen”</em> and look forward to seeing the Paschal candle every week at Church. After 40 days, we’ll celebrate the Ascension , followed by Pentecost in another 10 days. August 6th is Transfiguration, the Church New Year is September 1st, the Nativity of the Theotokos follows on September 8th, then the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross on September 14th…you get the idea. Plus we celebrate our family members’ (and friends’) patron saint days (or, as we call them, name days). Our year revolves around the Church year. We fast, feast and celebrate together. We have customs and traditions in our parish and at our home. It brings our life in Christ and the life of the Church into our every day in a whole new yet ancient way.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-conforms-us-we-dont-conform-it">11. The Church conforms us, we don’t conform it.</h2>

<p>During the Civil Rights march in Selma, Archbishop Demetrius marched and stood next to Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights movement didn’t altar the Church or change the Church, but the Civil Rights movement was rooted in unchanging truths evident within the Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy doesn’t change every few decades depending on how society changes, but remains a true and steady witness to Christ throughout history.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgy-becomes-a-part-of-you">12. The liturgy becomes a part of you.</h2>

<p>I never would have believed it at the time, but looking back, I can see that the churches I grew up in had their own liturgy. You go to church, there was upbeat fun music, it would slow down, the pastor would preached for 40 minutes, the lights would go down and slow music would start playing. It happened every week. While at ORU, I learned that there were formulas for this.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the liturgy we use is tried and true - most Sundays we pray the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a liturgy that has been used by the Church since the 4th century!</p>

    <p><em>Before I begin, I fully acknowledge that something like cremation may not <strong>seem</strong> to be a big theological issue - Christians today are getting cremated all the time and honored with “Celebrations of Life” instead of funerals (but that’s a topic for a whole different article) without giving it much thought. Unfortunately, it is a pretty big issue rooted in ancient heresy and a denial of basic Judeo-Christian beliefs.</em></p>

<h2 id="biblical-history-of-the-disposal-of-a-body">Biblical history of the disposal of a body</h2>
<p>Starting in Genesis, God was pretty clear with the fact that the body of someone who has fallen asleep in the Lord be buried in the earth. God told Abram (Abraham) that he would be “be buried in a good old age,” and when he died Isaac and Ishmael buried their father, just as the Lord had promised Abraham, next to Sarah (who Abraham had buried) (15:15, 29:9-10, 23:19).  The custom of burying the dead continues throughout the Old Testament: Rachel (Gen. 35:19-20). Isaac (Gen. 35:29), Jacob (Gen. 50), Joshua (Josh. 24:29-30), Eleazar (Josh 24:33), Samuel (1 Sam. 25:1) and David (1 Kings 2:10) were all buried. As a matter of fact, when Moses died, God buried him (Deut. 34:5-6). God lists among Moab’s transgressions the burning of the king of Edom’s bones to lime (Amos 2:1).</p>

<p>Let’s look at the New Testament: Christ was buried - for a few days at least -, Lazarus, John the Baptist and St. Stephen were all buried. There was definintely a pattern set in the Old Testament that carried over into the New Testament of burying the dead.</p>

<h2 id="burial-in-judaism">Burial in Judaism</h2>
<p>Before the time of Christ and to present day, Jewish custom and law does not allow for cremation.  The Talmud shows us that this was a common undertanding within Jewish culture from around the time of Christ when comments on <strong>__</strong>__, “You must bury him in entirety, not partially. From this verse we extrapolate that the command was not fulfilled if the person was partially buried (Nazir 7:1).” Judasim goes so far as to deny burial in a Jewish cemetery for someone who was voluntarily cremated and the laws of mourning are not observed! Why do they care?</p>

<p>For Jewish people, to destroy the body denies the resurrection. One is essentially casting away a body as if to say that it’s purpose is done. This is such a great offence that the Mishna teaches that anyone who denies the resurrection, will not be reunited with his or her own body (tractate Sanhedrin 10:1.).</p>

<p>In Jewish law, cremation is forbidden because of the belief that the human body belongs to God and is merely on loan to the person and it will be returned to God.  Coupling this with the belief that humanity was made in the image and likeness of God, desecrating the body, including cremation, is seen as a violation to God Himself</p>

<p>If the Jewish people care so much about the treatment of the body in the hopes of the resurrection, how much greater should we as a people care since we have seen Christ’s resurrection and participated in a foretaste of the general resurrection?</p>

<h2 id="does-it-really-matter">Does it really matter?</h2>

<p>For Christians, it definintely matters. We as Christians believe that when God created matter (the universe, the earth, plants, animals and man), it was good. Humanity was created in the image and likeness of God! Nothing else in all of creation can claim such a high station. Humanity was created body, mind (nous) and soul - this was good. Nowhere does God tell us that to seperate the body from the soul is good, but this was a consequence of the fall. Christ took on humanity, putting on flesh and becoming man, to redeem creation again after the fall, and when He raised from the dead, He was resurrected <em>bodily</em>. When He was crucified, St. Joseph of Arimathea requested His body to give it a proper burial. Our eschatatology teaches that we will be reunited with our bodies. They are not something to just burn, but instead something to take care of.</p>

<p>Not to mention, our bodies are not ours to destroy. “For do you not know…”
St. Paul prays, that our “and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and <strong>body</strong> be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Thessalonians 5:23). 9 “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 20 rfor you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body” (1 Corithians 6:19-20).</p>

<h2 id="a-pagan-and-gnostic-practice">A pagan and Gnostic practice</h2>
<p>Creamation has it’s roots in paganism, not in Judeo-Christian practices. We see cremation in places like India where it is closely aligned to a belief in reincarnation, something the Christian faith opposes. While that may not be enough to turn anyone from cremation, the Gnostic implications should be.</p>

<p>Gnosticism denies that created matter is good. Our bodies are merely shells that we are to leave behind so we can go to our higher being, as our spirit transcends the physical. It’s in Gnosticism that we see the idea that burning a body is okay because it’s just a body, but it’s not. Cremation undermines Christian ontology.  The teaching of respect for the body and burial was so important to early Christians that many risked their own lives to retrieve the body’s of martyrs. The Romans and other pagans knew this and were known to burn the bodies of martyred Christians in an attempt to destory their faith in the resurrection of hte body by rendering it impossible for resurrection. We know God is more powerful than anything that happens to our bodies and can resurrect us no matter what, but the point here is that it was a grevious insult to our forefathers and mothers of the faith to burn their bodies and now we have Chrisitians readily giving their bodies over to the inceneators and crematorium</p>

<p>The pagans, to destroy faith in the resurrection of the body, often cast the corpses of martyred Christians into the flames, fondly believing thus to render impossible the resurrection of the body.</p>

<p>Christians would lay the bodies of their loved ones in <em>coemeterium</em>, which is a Latin term that takes it’s name from the Greek word  <em>κοιμητήριον</em> which means literally “<em>sleeping place</em>.”  This term reflects the view that the early Christians had of personhood and how it relates to the body. Not to mention, as illustrated previously, the body was not, and should not be seen as something we can dispose of or destroy, because it doesn’t belog to us, but ultimately belongs to God.</p>

<p>Our bodies are precious, created and fashioned by God as part of who we are in His image and likeness. We were not made to be seperated from our bodies and will once again be reunited with them for all of eternity. Maybe they are something we should plan to give honor and respect to, even after we’ve fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection.</p>

<h2 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure</h2>
<p><em>I’ve wanted to write a listicle about the Orthodox Church, my home within Christianity, for quite some time. But, as often happens, I got distracted and never finished it, until today. So what changed? I saw an <a href="http://benirwin.me/2015/01/22/11-things-about-the-episcopal-church/">article</a> shared by my friend <a href="http://audreyeclectic.blogspot.com/">Heather</a> about the 11 things someone loves about the Episcopal Church. It inspired me to write this, not as a rebuttal or a “We’re better than you,” but to share some of what in Orthodoxy keeps me connected to Christ, to the Church and to my brothers and sisters in Christ. That being said, thank you Ben and Heather for the inspiration and I hope I can do justice to the beauty of Orthodoxy.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-journey-to-orthodoxy">My Journey to Orthodoxy</h2>

<p>I joined the Orthodox Church almost 14 years ago after feeling lost within the Charismatic/Evangelical world. I was attending Oral Roberts University and had way too many questions to know where to start. I had begun studying some Church History and was at a point where I was torn between Catholocism and Anglicanism, not feeling terribly comfortable with either option and my roommate was considering Messianic Judaism. The two of us were longing for something we couldn’t find and got to a point when we got a $1 loaf of french bread and bottle of grape juice to have communion in our room because we didn’t really know where we belonged.</p>

<p>Then one night, I was in someone’s dorm and saw a copy of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Eastern_Orthodox_Christianity.html?id=2B8lAQAAIAAJ">Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective</a> on his table. While I don’t recommend the book, it was enough to get me asking what Orthodox was. I did some research online, ordered a ton of books, and got everything I could from the library. The more I read, the more I felt at peace about things I’d been questioning. I prayerfully read, started attending <a href="http://www.stanontytulsa.com">my parish</a> here in town and was chrismated into the Church and I’ve never looked back. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-to-figure-it-all-out">1. I don’t have to figure it all out.</h2>

<p>On Sunday mornings, when Fr. George begins to preach his homily, I listen and take what he teaches as spiritual food and edification. I do the same thing no matter which parish I visit because priests are connected to the Apostolic Tradition. They don’t spend time trying to think up new doctrine or theological opinions, because they participate in the continuation of the preaching and teaching (the kyrgma) of the Apostles.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy--orthopraxis-go-hand-in-hand">2. Orthodoxy &amp; Orthopraxis go hand in hand</h2>

<p>The holy apostles taught us to “hold fast to the traditions “</p>

<h2 id="we-worship-with-our-whole-being">4. We worship with our whole being</h2>

<p>Orthodox worship engages all of the senses, taking worship about of a theoretical place, and grounding it here, in something tangible. We cross ourselves, offer metenias, prostrate, process - all forms of worship involving movement, engaging our bodies. As we look around, we are surrounded by the icons of Christ and His saints, we hear the chanting and the bells, we smell the incense, we taste the fountain of immortality in the Eucharist - our whole person is engaged in worship, as it should be because, afterall, when God created us He said, “It is good.”</p>

<p>Our senses engaged in worship speaks to our view of humankind - we are not evil. Our bodies are not evil. We weren’t created to die, the seperation of body and soul is a consequence of the fall, not part of God’s design. Our free will seperates us, but it was Christ’s incarnation, a good and loving Christ who put on humanity, that redeemed the material world.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-is-connected">5. Orthodoxy is connected</h2>

<p>When I go to an Orthodox Church, I know what to expect. Every Orthodox Church, throughout the entire world will be participating in the same liturgy I am. I am part of something much larger, part of communities of people I’ve never met with languages and cultural customs I know nothing about. A few years ago, I visited a Serbian parish that was near my parents. I <em>should</em> have done my research, but I didn’t and when I got there the entire liturgy was in Serbian. Despite the fact that I obviously don’t understand more than a couple of Serbian words, I was actively involed in the liturgy. I knew what the priest was saying, I knew what the chanters were chanting and I was able to participate in this glorious service, commune and fellowship with my brothers and sisters in Christ after service.</p>

<p>But the connection is deeper - as I look at the icons on the walls, I am connected with those saints. I am praying the same prayers they prayed, I am singing the same hymns they sang, I am receiving the same Eucharist they received. We are connected as the Church militant in a very real way to the Church invisible because,  <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews+12/">“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-begin-or-end-liturgy-we-merely-join-in">6. We don’t begin or end liturgy, we merely join in</h2>

<p>The Bible shows us insights into Heaven. We see</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-embraces-mystery">7. Orthodoxy embraces Mystery.</h2>
<p>As an Orthodox Christian, I don’t have to try to explain everything. I know that God is bigger than I am and that my ways truly are not His ways.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-and-individual-worship-is-a-part-of-the-christian-life">8. Corporate and Individual Worship is a part of the Christian life</h2>
<p>Orthodox Churches are all laid out the same - we walk into the narthex, enter into the nave and face the altar. The nave is like a ship,</p>

<h2 id="confession-is-freeing">9. Confession is freeing.</h2>
<p>I have a spiritual father, not just a priest, but someone who knows me inside and out, all of my deepest darkest secrets who helps me navigate through the Christian life. After I’ve prayerfully prepared for Confession, I go to our parish and stand with my priest before the icon of Christ at the front of our parish. As I confess, I make my confession to Christ and sometimes I’m granted the freeing tears of repentence. Once I’ve finished, Fr. George confirms Christ’s forgiveness and the remission of sins. But that’s not all, he counsels me with spiritual wisdom that helps me grow in Christ. The Church, through confession, helps us to rise up and become who we are supposed to be in Christ. We are conformed to the image and likeness of Christ. After I confess, I feel free. The sins that I’ve committed, both out in the open and those that I think have been done in secret, once confessed, lose their hold on me. I no longer feel the weight of guilt, but instead know that I can be more than who I am.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgcial-calendar">10. The Liturgcial Calendar</h2>
<p>I always loved Christmas - the decorations, the Christmas music we sang in Church, the reading of the Nativity story. Now I love the rest of the events in Christ’s life, along with the events of the Early Church as well lives of the Theotokos and saints and major events in the life of the Church throughout history. The Israelites remembered important days in which God intervened and helped them as Feast Days, days Christ and the Apostles kept.</p>

<p>We just celebrated Pascha (Easter) a few weeks ago and every day, we remember that we are in the Paschal season: I find myself sing the Paschal troparion <em>Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!</em> and the Paschal antiphons, I greet other members of the Church by saying <em>“Christ is Risen”</em> and look forward to seeing the Paschal candle every week at Church. After 40 days, we’ll celebrate the Ascension , followed by Pentecost in another 10 days. August 6th is Transfiguration, the Church New Year is September 1st, the Nativity of the Theotokos follows on September 8th, then the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross on September 14th…you get the idea. Plus we celebrate our family members’ (and friends’) patron saint days (or, as we call them, name days). Our year revolves around the Church year. We fast, feast and celebrate together. We have customs and traditions in our parish and at our home. It brings our life in Christ and the life of the Church into our every day in a whole new yet ancient way.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-conforms-us-we-dont-conform-it">11. The Church conforms us, we don’t conform it.</h2>

<p>During the Civil Rights march in Selma, Archbishop Demetrius marched and stood next to Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights movement didn’t altar the Church or change the Church, but the Civil Rights movement was rooted in unchanging truths evident within the Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy doesn’t change every few decades depending on how society changes, but remains a true and steady witness to Christ throughout history.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgy-becomes-a-part-of-you">12. The liturgy becomes a part of you.</h2>

<p>I never would have believed it at the time, but looking back, I can see that the churches I grew up in had their own liturgy. You go to church, there was upbeat fun music, it would slow down, the pastor would preached for 40 minutes, the lights would go down and slow music would start playing. It happened every week. While at ORU, I learned that there were formulas for this.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the liturgy we use is tried and true - most Sundays we pray the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a liturgy that has been used by the Church since the 4th century!</p>
