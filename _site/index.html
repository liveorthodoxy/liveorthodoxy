    <p>The Advent season is upon us. For us Orthodox Christians, we are over 2 weeks into our time to prepare for Christmas; our Nativity Fast begins 40 days before Christmas on November 15th. This year for some reason, I’ve been asked quite a few times why we fast in preparation for Christmas, which is strange because I haven’t heard that question about it in years. Since it has come up, I’ve been thinking more about the fast period and what it means to me.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point-of-the-fast">What’s the point of the Fast?</h2>

<p>We see from the Bible that fasting is pretty necessary. Before Christ began his ministry, He went to the desert and fasted and when the Apostles couldn’t exorcize the demon, Christ told them could only cast it out through prayer and fasting, just as a couple of examples. But, the fast of Moses, also for 40 days, is the basis of our Nativity fast. Before he received the commandments on Mount Sinai, Moses fasted. We also fast in anticipation of receiving from God, but, instead of commandments, we will receive the living Word of God, the second person of the Trinity, Incarnate. St. Symon of Thessaloniki explains this far better than I could dream to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The Nativity Forty-day Fast represents the fast undertaken by Moses, who—having fasted for forty days and forty nights—received the Commandments of God, written on stone tablets. And we, fasting for forty days, will reflect upon and receive from the Virgin the living Word—not written upon stone, but born, incarnate—and we will commune of His Divine Body.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our focus is shifted from the consumerism and stress that has become synonymous with the Holiday Season to focus instead on our spiritual life, preparing ourselves to receive Christ, both allegorically and quite literally through the Eucharist.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-being-anticipated">What is being anticipated?</h2>

<p>The Western Christian term of <em>Advent</em> literally means coming or arrival and sums up this time of year nicely. What does that mean? Think of it as expecting Christ in three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Historical.</em> There was a time when Israel looked forward to the Messiah when they waited for God to deliver them. We read about this longing throughout the Old Testament, throughout the Psalms, in the prophets, and the histories. It’s a common theme - Israel needed to be redeemed. During Advent, we remember this time and imagine what it was like for Israel, looking outward for hope and deliverance.</li>
  <li><em>Present.</em> We all need Christ in our lives, to enlighten our lives. Throughout the year, we greet one another by professing “Christ is in our midst,” and we reply, “He is and ever shall be.”  We know Christ is here, that we live in with Christ and Christ is with us, but there are times in our life when we feel so far from Him. So, when I sing my favorite Christmas song, “O Come, O Come Emmanuel,” I am asking for Christ to come, or, more appropriately, for me to see Him here. Remember the preparation for communion prayer of St. John Chrysostom where we pray, “As You consented to lie in a cave, in a manger of dumb beasts, so also consent to lie in the manger of my unspiritual soul and to enter my defiled body.“</li>
  <li><em>Future.</em> In some ways, we are still like the Israelites. Even though Christ took on humanity through the Incarnation and has made it possible for us to become as He is, we are still anticipating Christ’s return. As we proclaim in the Creed, we expect Christ “will come again with glory.” This is something we anticipate, we are waiting for, just as all Christians throughout the ages have. It is a part of who we are as Christians and during the fast, something we can contemplate even more than we usually do.</li>
</ol>

<p>This year, during Advent, let us anticipate Christ, remembering the anticipation of Israel for a Messiah, longing to be closer to Christ in our lives, and looking forward to His return.</p>

    <p>We Orthodox are a thankful bunch; we give thanks to God when we wake in the morning and before we go to sleep, during our hours of prayer and during the Divine Liturgy. Our whole lives are a time for us to offer thanks to God.  That doesn’t negate the fact that I love Thanksgiving, the day that we as a nation take some time to pause and reflect on the many blessings we each have.</p>

<p>This year has been a big year for us in our house and I’d like to take a few moments to share my gratitude. In February, our sweet little Elise was born, a healthy beautiful baby girl. For the past nine months, we have been blessed to watch her grow, learn and develop her personality each and every day. I’ve watched her laugh, crawl, talk, stand, wave, point and learn to make everyone around her laugh. She’s the single most precious thing in our lives, and I can’t begin to offer any thanks to God that would be worthy of the most incredible blessing I have in my life. I get to share this experience with my best friend, my beloved companion, my partner in crime, my wife. We wouldn’t have her if it weren’t for her birth mother and father, to whom we are also grateful.</p>

<p>By the grace of God, I was ordained to the holy diaconate. I am thankful every week when I stand in front and kiss of the altar and when Father George places the body of Christ in my hand. It is a great responsibility, and I thank God that I can serve our parish and the Holy Church.</p>

<p>I am blessed to have a loving and supportive family, on my side and Christine’s. Our friends and church family add to our lives and help us as we help Ellie grow up to be the amazing girl I know she will be.  They are so much more than I deserve.</p>

<p>I know we offer thanks every day, but today, I’m taking the time to share my thanks for everything God gives me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Everlasting King, Thy will for our salvation is full of power. Thy right arm controls the whole course of human life. We give Thee thanks for all Thy mercies, seen and unseen. For eternal life, for the heavenly Joys of the Kingdom which is to be. Grant mercy to us who sing Thy praise, both now and in the time to come. Glory to Thee, O God, from age to age.</em></p>
</blockquote>

    <p>I wish I could claim originality in my inspiration for this, but I can’t. An author and blogger I follow <a href="http://blogs.ancientfaith.com/nearlyorthodox/">Angela Doll Carlson</a> shared a thought on a Facebook group we’re both a part of that caused me to pause and think - <em>“Stop talking about whether or not something is politically correct. Ask instead whether if is kind. Let’s aim for kindness.”</em> For some reason, this struck me - if we could just focus on showing kindness, how much better would things be?</p>

<h2 id="love-is-kind">Love is Kind</h2>

<p>We’re all familiar with what Christ taught in Matthew 22:36-40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is love? Among other things, it is kind, as St. Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 13. It’s something we as Christians are called to, kindness. Political correctness, in theory, centers around the idea that all people deserve respect and honor. We don’t use terms to describe people that they consider offensive, we don’t marginalize or demean someone based on their ethnicity, gender, age, intelligence, disability or other traits. And yet I count the number of times I’ve heard statements like, “I know this isn’t politically correct, but…” from Christians and non-Christians alike.</p>

<p>Angela’s post left me thinking about kindness in our everyday lives. Is it kind to discriminate, make sexist or sexual comments, to demean another person, to use terms that would offend someone? No, it most certainly isn’t. If it isn’t kind, then it isn’t love. If it isn’t love we are showing others, our neighbors, then it’s probably a safe bet to assume we are not living up to the call of Christ, we are not being strong ambassadors of Christ. I’m sure there are exceptions, but as a good rule of thumb, they go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>It’s sad that in today’s society, I see so many people espousing hateful rhetoric, racism, sexism, and childish name-calling - Christians and non-Christians alike. There is no regard for political correctness, much less kindness. As a matter of fact, the word “political” is so divisive and polarizing. This election has, in my opinion, brought out the worst in people, on both sides of the aisle, and our society has taken a step back, or perhaps opened a door that had been shut for awhile. People say hateful things; others return in kind (I have had to repent for my words over the last few months). I found encouragement in reading the words of the Elder Thaddeus who taught:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is not good when we return the love of those who love us, yet hate those who hate us. We are not on the right path if we do this. We are the sons of light and love, the sons of God, his children. As such we must have His qualities and His attributes of love, peace, and kindness towards all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, we as Christians are called to a higher standard, to be more than that which is around us and now is a great time to work together to forget political correctness and focus on what we as Christians are called to do, and that’s to show love as Christ commanded. We can be a light in the world because, as St. John of Kronstadt tells us, <em>”Evil and faults are corrected by good, by love, kindness, meekness, humility, and patience.”</em> St. Paul lays out what love is very clearly for us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>May we all look to all of our neighbors and find kindness in our hearts, offering prayers for those we agree with and those we don’t and answering the call Christ has set before us, to walk in love.</p>

    <p>I like to consider myself an amateur Orthodox apologist focusing on modern religious movements - amateur being the operative word in that sentence. When I’m traveling and I see the Jehovah’s Witnesses in a busy thoroughfare or in an airport, I always stop to pick up their newest Watchtower literature which I give a cursory read on the plane. While in Seattle a few weeks ago, I drove by the Mormon Temple and saw a group of missionaries in their perfectly pressed white shirts and ties and their Elder name badges. This got me to thinking about how we about something I don’t usually - at what we can learn from these groups and how they try to reach people.</p>

<h2 id="knock-knock">Knock knock</h2>

<p>I realized that both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses have a special passion for outreach and missionary work. This <em>should</em> seem obvious since they come to my house a few times a year and leave literature, but I had been so focused on where they were off on doctrinal issues, that I didn’t see an area where we as Orthodox Christians are missing the mark.</p>

<p>Mormon and Jehovah’s Witness members all commit to missionary work. It looks different for both groups: young Mormon men and women receive training before devoting themselves to missionary work - young men go for two years, young women for one year. They are assigned to a certain geographical area and given a partner to work with and make themselves busy going door-to-door sharing their faith. Jehovah’s Witnesses volunteer to go out in groups from their local Kingdom Halls (what they call their parishes). Some go out with friends, some with their whole family, children included. Even Prince was known to go knocking on doors in his home town of Minneapolis. What is most troubling to me, is the effectiveness these groups see from these efforts.</p>

<h2 id="and-what-do-i-do">And what do I do?</h2>

<p>While thinking on the level of commitment they give to sharing their faith, I was troubled my own personal lack of missionary mindedness for outreach and spreading the Gospel. I’m not advocating that we as Orthodox Christians need to develop hard and fast rules for going door to door throughout the world knocking and going through a rigid training program or using books with appendixes that we can flip to and give a textbook answer for any question that could come up. That’s not what Orthodoxy is about and that’s not how historical Christianity has gone about witnessing the Gospel of Christ, but I do think we need to look at the great commission we have from Christ to,”…..” and find how to live that call.</p>

<p>When is the last time you invited a friend to Church? How about a friend who isn’t religious? It’s easy for me to talk to my Evangelical friends about Holy Orthodoxy and share the fullness of the faith, but I’m not usually the best about sharing as deeply with the unchurched, the agnostics or the atheists I know. Part of this is from my background as an Evangelical where, at least in my Church, we militantly talked about Christ’s sacrifice and how our decisions here on earth affect the afterlife, without carrying the grace needed to have those conversations. That’s at least part of the reason so many people are turned off from Christianity.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-answer">So what’s the answer?</h2>
<p>In short, I don’t have a quick and easy answer, but I have some ideas we could use as a starting place for a bigger dialogue together. I know there are wonderful members of the faithful who are reaching out and would be far more suited to lead this discussion and I hope to find some who would be willing to teach the rest of us. We also have a wonderful missionary effort through groups like IOCC and men and women who give up everything and move their families to work throughout the world sharing the Gospel. But what about those of us here at home - what can we do?</p>

<h4 id="invite-friends-to-church">Invite friends to Church</h4>
<p>This seems simple enough. I try to bring many of my friends to our parish. I find services like the Pashca Rush and Liturgy, the blessing of the waters at Ephipany, feasts that don’t fall on Sundays, Vespers and Lityas to be nice intros to Orthodoxy. It’s great to bring friends, but it’s also important to prep them for their first visit.  An Orthodox service can be overwhelming, many people aren’t use to the sights, sounds and smells of Orthodoxy so a little additional time spent explaining these things is helpful. Point out examples in the Scriptures of how we worship (singing of the Psalms in Collasians 3:16 and  Ephesians 5:18-20, incense is used in Heaven throughout the book of Isiah, Daniel and Revelation, the Apostles prayed “the prayers” in Acts 10:2-3, the Early Church used a liturgical calendar as we see in Acts 20:6 and 1 Corinthians 16:8).</p>

<h4 id="pray">Pray</h4>
<p>As Christians, we are called to “pray without ceasing,” and we try to do this as we pray for friends and family, follow our daily prayer rule, remember the Jesus Prayer all throughout the day, but there are times where we can easily pray with our friends. When we are eating out at a restaurant, ask if your friends will pray with you. I have yet to have anyone object to praying for a food blessing with me. In our house, we pray before each and every meal so this isn’t unnatural for us, as it won’t be for most of you.</p>

<h4 id="visit-food-and-ethnic-festivals">Visit Food and Ethnic Festivals</h4>
<p>We have two festivals here in Tulsa, Greek Fest at Holy Trinity and Hafli at my parish, St. Antony. I <strong>love</strong> bringing friends to the festivals. It’s a fun, non-threatening way to introduce people to Holy Orthodoxy and you’re helping to support a parish since these are usually fundraisers. Check the schedule and see if there are tours that you and your friends can go one because there is always something that we can learn as well. Our priest does amazing tours and I always walk away with something new.  If there aren’t tours, or a tour time doesn’t work for you, ask if a deacon, subdeacon, reader or someone else at the parish can lead a tour or get a blessing from your priest to do a tour for your friends.</p>

<p>As an aside, our temples are powerful witnesses to Christianity and Orthodoxy. I had been reading about Orthodoxy while at college. When home for Christmas break, I visited St. George Houston and met now Khouria Gigi Shadid. My friends and I were supposed to meet with the priest but there was a miscommunication on what time we were coming, so we were blessed with a tour for Khouria Gigi. She explained the layout of the parish, the icons, the altar and how these come to life and engage Christians during worship. When I left, I told my friends I was home. I came back to college, met my now spiritual Father and told him I wanted to join the Church. These can be powerful.</p>

<h4 id="offer-to-host-an-event-or-talk">Offer to Host an Event or Talk</h4>
<p>If this doesn’t work, talk to your priest and see about doing a community event. When our bishop came to visit a few years ago, His Grace Bishop +BASIL did an enlightening talk on the Theotokos that was great for the Orthodox and non-Orthodox alike. After the movie <strong>American Sniper</strong> came out, it inspired our priest to do an amazing talk about the movie and how it applies to our spiritual life. Father George, who is a combat vet from Vietnam, talked about his experience and the work of spiritual warfare, pulling things from the movie that most of us never would have caught. We had a few talks because the community was so interested in the presentation.</p>

<h4 id="share-something-from-ancient-faith-radio">Share something from Ancient Faith Radio</h4>
<p>Here in America we are blessed to have Ancient Faith Radio. They have podcasts on almost any topic you could imagine. You can send a friend a link or download a podcast and put it on a thumb drive. Their blogs are great too. I would love it if friends would read books, but that’s a commitment and if they aren’t yet interested in Orthodoxy, that can be tough. AFR has great blogs that you can share that can be read in 5 or 10 minutes, something most people are willing to commit if you offer it to them.</p>

<h4 id="be-the-light">Be the Light</h4>

<p>We as Orthodox have a great opportunity to be the light of Christ, to show His love in our daily lives. We do this by not engaging in gossip or hateful conversations, helping those around us, praying for and with those in need, practicing Christian hospitality and countless other ways.</p>

<p>If we all try some of these, I think we could easily bring Orthodoxy to more people, sharing the faith in a practical and real way. We don’t need to engage in arguments or debates, Bible thump or anything like this. St. Paul calls us ambassadors of Christ, and this is what we are called to be, meaning we are to act as Christ, preaching and living the Gospel in love.</p>

  <p><em>TL:DR- Doctrine matters. It’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings. This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-who-do-you-say-that-i-am---mark-829">“But who do you say that I am?” - Mark 8:29</h2>
<p>When Jesus asked this question to the Apostle Peter nearly 2,000 years ago, he asked a question that would need to be answered by each and every person who would come in contact with the Gospel. As Christianity spread, and the number of those who professed a faith in Christ grew, the number of interpretations of that question also grew, some times to the detriment of believers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-creed">What is a Creed?</h2>
<p>Creed comes from the Latin word <em>credo</em> meaning “to believe.”  I know for many Protestants, the term Creed is far too restrictive and formal, so they’ve developed their own statements of belief or confession of faith; despite what it may be called, it is ultimately a Creed.  For the Orthodox Church, no Creed is more widely expressed than the Nicene Creed (sometimes called the Nicene-Constantinople Creed).</p>

<p>Creeds are not unique to Christianity; Judaism professes the <em><strong>Shema Yisrael</strong></em> (<em>“Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</em> Deuteronomy 6:4) and Islam professes their creed, the shahada which says, <em>“There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God.”</em></p>

<h2 id="creeds-in-the-new-testament">Creeds in the New Testament</h2>

<p>In the early Church, there were simple creeds that addressed the problems that faced the various Churches. A great example is what is referred to as the <em>Pre-Pauline Creed</em> of 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 which says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <strong>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</strong> (English Standard Version).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s called the Pre-Pauline Creed because it is a creed that Paul is obviously quoting, which existed before he was converted as we see from his statement, “which I also received” in verse 3.</p>

<p>St. Paul again quotes part of an early creed when he writes to St. Timothy 3:16, <em>”We confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.”</em></p>

<p>All of these are a continual development of the Church answering Christ’s question, “Who do you say that I am?”</p>

<h2 id="the-creed-of-the-early-church">The Creed of the Early Church</h2>
<p>Just as the different New Testament communities developed creeds to ensure safe guards around correct teaching, the Early Church had issues that arose and they too needed to define doctrine.  The most well known Creed in Christendom is the Nicene Creed.  In the fourth century, a doctrine was spreading that denied Christ’s divine nature called Arianism. This doctrine threatened the sound Christian doctrine and our understanding of who Christ is.  The leaders of the Church came together in the city of Nicea and all 318 successors to the Apostles unanimously agreed on a formula to articulate the person of Christ.  This formula became the Nicene Creed.  The faithful members of the Church affirm this belief regularly to safe guard against false teaching.  The beauty of the Creed is best explained by the late Yale professor, Dr. Jaroslav Pelikan who said, <em>”The singing of the creed is a very important and cherished way of indicating a universality of the faith across not only space but time — to know that in the Philippines this morning, this was the creed that was recited and to know that the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century and my late father and grandfather all affirmed this, all of us together.”</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>There’s this idea of unity between several strains of Christianity that exists outside of doctrine. It seems to me that there’s laissez-faire attitude towards doctrine and belief, that an understanding of the nature of God, man, salvation, etc is of less importance than a semblance of unity.</p>

<p>Sadly, I’ve heard several Christians say they are Christians because of a unique experience or a feeling they get. I’m not going to say that there’s no place for personal feelings or experience within Christianity, but instead that it isn’t all we need.  Those of other faiths heavily draw on the emotions and personal experiences.  Take for examples the Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) missionaries. When they begin visiting with non-LDS about the LDS Church, they cite from their Doctrine &amp; Covenants (one of their books of scripture along with the Bible, Book of Mormon and Articles of Faith) and claim Christ said <em>”But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right <strong>I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right</strong>.”</em> (D&amp;C 9:8)  When talking to someone who joins the LDS church, they will confirm the burning in the bosom as their proof of faith. When faith and truth are based primarily on experience, how does one question the validity of something like this? People join the LDS church despite the fact that they teach things outside of the Nicene Creed and historical Christian teachings, like God was once a man who was elevated to God. When no emphasis exists on truth and correct doctrine, doors like this are left wide open.</p>

<p>If people are taught to base their religious belief solely on emotional responses, how can they be  <em>”prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope”</em> found in the Gospel (1 Peter 3:15)?  The Apostles never appeared to anyone and discussed how they were made to feel by an encounter, but instead they boldly and firmly proclaimed the teachings of Jesus Christ and the revelations of the Prophets.</p>

<p>Even in the New Testament there were those who changed the teachings delivered by the Apostles and, as St. Paul taught, <em>”a little leaven leavens the whole loaf”</em> (Galatians 5:9). The Epistles of St. John were written in large part to encourage the faithful to remain steadfast in right doctrine and not to follow false teachers.</p>

<p>That’s why the New Testament warns us to, <em>”watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught,”</em> and not to <em>”be led away by diverse and strange teachings”</em> (Romans 16:17; Hebrews 13:9). Instead, we are encouraged to <em>”keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers”</em> 1 Timothy 4:16.</p>

<p>The successors to the Apostles took the teachings and traditions handed to them and passed them to their successors and preserved them. That’s the goal of a creed - to give the faithful within the community a set of boundaries of safe doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="after-all-christ-called-us-all-to-be-one-right">After all, Christ called us all to be one, right?</h2>
<p>In short, it’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings.  <em>”For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths”</em> (2 Timothy 4:3-4). The creeds give us formulas of doctrine that explain what we believe.</p>

<p>I like what the <em>Orthodoxy &amp; Heterodoxy</em> blog has to say on the matter, <em>”Theology is not just life and death, but _eternal</em> life and death. We have to get it right not just so we can belong to the right churchy club, but so we can grab hold of sanity in an insane world, so we can seek out the profound while surrounded by triviality, so we can pursue beauty in the midst of ugliness…Doctrine includes not just dogma, but every teaching and true tradition pertaining to union with the Holy Trinity—worship, asceticism, hierarchy, canonical tradition, and so forth. Doctrine is what we are taught and what we teach.”_  If we are not committed to getting that right, what are we committed to?</p>

<p>This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</p>

<h2 id="the-nicene-creed">The Nicene Creed</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages, Light of Light, True God of True God, Begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made: Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;	And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;	And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets; And I believe in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the Life of the age to come. Amen.</p>
