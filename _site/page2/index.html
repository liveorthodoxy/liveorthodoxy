  <p><em>TL:DR- Doctrine matters. It’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings. This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-who-do-you-say-that-i-am---mark-829">“But who do you say that I am?” - Mark 8:29</h2>
<p>When Jesus asked this question to the Apostle Peter nearly 2,000 years ago, he asked a question that would need to be answered by each and every person who would come in contact with the Gospel. As Christianity spread, and the number of those who professed a faith in Christ grew, the number of interpretations of that question also grew, some times to the detriment of believers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-creed">What is a Creed?</h2>
<p>Creed comes from the Latin word <em>credo</em> meaning “to believe.”  I know for many Protestants, the term Creed is far too restrictive and formal, so they’ve developed their own statements of belief or confession of faith; despite what it may be called, it is ultimately a Creed.  For the Orthodox Church, no Creed is more widely expressed than the Nicene Creed (sometimes called the Nicene-Constantinople Creed).</p>

<p>Creeds are not unique to Christianity; Judaism professes the <em><strong>Shema Yisrael</strong></em> (<em>“Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</em> Deuteronomy 6:4) and Islam professes their creed, the shahada which says, <em>“There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God.”</em></p>

<h2 id="creeds-in-the-new-testament">Creeds in the New Testament</h2>

<p>In the early Church, there were simple creeds that addressed the problems that faced the various Churches. A great example is what is referred to as the <em>Pre-Pauline Creed</em> of 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 which says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <strong>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</strong> (English Standard Version).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s called the Pre-Pauline Creed because it is a creed that Paul is obviously quoting, which existed before he was converted as we see from his statement, “which I also received” in verse 3.</p>

<p>St. Paul again quotes part of an early creed when he writes to St. Timothy 3:16, <em>”We confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.”</em></p>

<p>All of these are a continual development of the Church answering Christ’s question, “Who do you say that I am?”</p>

<h2 id="the-creed-of-the-early-church">The Creed of the Early Church</h2>
<p>Just as the different New Testament communities developed creeds to ensure safe guards around correct teaching, the Early Church had issues that arose and they too needed to define doctrine.  The most well known Creed in Christendom is the Nicene Creed.  In the fourth century, a doctrine was spreading that denied Christ’s divine nature called Arianism. This doctrine threatened the sound Christian doctrine and our understanding of who Christ is.  The leaders of the Church came together in the city of Nicea and all 318 successors to the Apostles unanimously agreed on a formula to articulate the person of Christ.  This formula became the Nicene Creed.  The faithful members of the Church affirm this belief regularly to safe guard against false teaching.  The beauty of the Creed is best explained by the late Yale professor, Dr. Jaroslav Pelikan who said, <em>”The singing of the creed is a very important and cherished way of indicating a universality of the faith across not only space but time — to know that in the Philippines this morning, this was the creed that was recited and to know that the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century and my late father and grandfather all affirmed this, all of us together.”</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>There’s this idea of unity between several strains of Christianity that exists outside of doctrine. It seems to me that there’s laissez-faire attitude towards doctrine and belief, that an understanding of the nature of God, man, salvation, etc is of less importance than a semblance of unity.</p>

<p>Sadly, I’ve heard several Christians say they are Christians because of a unique experience or a feeling they get. I’m not going to say that there’s no place for personal feelings or experience within Christianity, but instead that it isn’t all we need.  Those of other faiths heavily draw on the emotions and personal experiences.  Take for examples the Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) missionaries. When they begin visiting with non-LDS about the LDS Church, they cite from their Doctrine &amp; Covenants (one of their books of scripture along with the Bible, Book of Mormon and Articles of Faith) and claim Christ said <em>”But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right <strong>I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right</strong>.”</em> (D&amp;C 9:8)  When talking to someone who joins the LDS church, they will confirm the burning in the bosom as their proof of faith. When faith and truth are based primarily on experience, how does one question the validity of something like this? People join the LDS church despite the fact that they teach things outside of the Nicene Creed and historical Christian teachings, like God was once a man who was elevated to God. When no emphasis exists on truth and correct doctrine, doors like this are left wide open.</p>

<p>If people are taught to base their religious belief solely on emotional responses, how can they be  <em>”prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope”</em> found in the Gospel (1 Peter 3:15)?  The Apostles never appeared to anyone and discussed how they were made to feel by an encounter, but instead they boldly and firmly proclaimed the teachings of Jesus Christ and the revelations of the Prophets.</p>

<p>Even in the New Testament there were those who changed the teachings delivered by the Apostles and, as St. Paul taught, <em>”a little leaven leavens the whole loaf”</em> (Galatians 5:9). The Epistles of St. John were written in large part to encourage the faithful to remain steadfast in right doctrine and not to follow false teachers.</p>

<p>That’s why the New Testament warns us to, <em>”watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught,”</em> and not to <em>”be led away by diverse and strange teachings”</em> (Romans 16:17; Hebrews 13:9). Instead, we are encouraged to <em>”keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers”</em> 1 Timothy 4:16.</p>

<p>The successors to the Apostles took the teachings and traditions handed to them and passed them to their successors and preserved them. That’s the goal of a creed - to give the faithful within the community a set of boundaries of safe doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="after-all-christ-called-us-all-to-be-one-right">After all, Christ called us all to be one, right?</h2>
<p>In short, it’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings.  <em>”For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths”</em> (2 Timothy 4:3-4). The creeds give us formulas of doctrine that explain what we believe.</p>

<p>I like what the <em>Orthodoxy &amp; Heterodoxy</em> blog has to say on the matter, <em>”Theology is not just life and death, but _eternal</em> life and death. We have to get it right not just so we can belong to the right churchy club, but so we can grab hold of sanity in an insane world, so we can seek out the profound while surrounded by triviality, so we can pursue beauty in the midst of ugliness…Doctrine includes not just dogma, but every teaching and true tradition pertaining to union with the Holy Trinity—worship, asceticism, hierarchy, canonical tradition, and so forth. Doctrine is what we are taught and what we teach.”_  If we are not committed to getting that right, what are we committed to?</p>

<p>This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</p>

<h2 id="the-nicene-creed">The Nicene Creed</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages, Light of Light, True God of True God, Begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made: Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;	And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;	And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets; And I believe in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the Life of the age to come. Amen.</p>

    <p>I’ve been jotting down notes periodically about our new life with Ellie and am now starting to take those random notes and write about our experience. Here’s the first one I’m ready to share.</p>

<h2 id="day-6">Day 6</h2>

<p>As Elise awoke, at 1:00 am this morning, the third time already tonight since I laid down at 11:00, I got up and went through our usual routine. She’s only been home for 4 days, but we’ve begun developing a new normal together. I’m new to parenting and I’ve already learned it’s trial by far because newborns aren’t the most patient creatures on the planet.</p>

<p>I picked up our precious baby to check and change her diaper. After that, I stared into her little eyes, darting around trying to take in everything around her before becoming fixed on my face. I smiled and kissed her. Her precious little mouth pursed and she stuck her tongue out a few times. She was telling me she was hungry the only way she knew how. So we walked to the kitchen and I made her a bottle. We came to the couch and sat down together, letting my wife sleep so she hopefully felt better the next morning. I turned on my phone and we listened to some chanting of the Psalms as she ate. Once done, I burped her and walked her back to her bassinet. We had been sleeping in our living room to get our two dogs use to the idea of this new furless puppy that they didn’t understand. Christine thought of placing her bassinet in front of our icon wall so Christ along with the Theotokos and the angels and saints could watch over her as she slept. As I looked at her there so peacefully asleep, it hit me, I had been praying <em>for</em> Elise, but hadn’t prayed <em>with</em> Elise.</p>

<p>I knew it was late, we were well past the setting of the sun, but I grabbed our prayerbook and, holding her in one arm and swaying, Elise and I prayed Vespers together. Sure she slept and made tiny human sleep noises in my ear, but I held her close and prayed out loud. I love Vespers, it’s a service that really resonates with me everytime, most likely because of my deep interest in the creation story. I can read the first three chapters of Genesis 1,000 times and still feel like there’s more that I’m not getting it.</p>

<p>This was our routine for a few nights, but the prayerbook became cumbersome and difficult to navigate while holding a baby. That’s when I switched the <a href="http://orthodox.seasidehosting.st/current_service">Dynamic Horologion</a> on my phone. It’s a perfect way to pray with a baby. I can easily hold it in one hand and, now that I wear her in her <a href="http://www.boba.com/">Boba wrap</a>, I can use my other hand to caress her back. Plus, it has the current service available and all of the variable changes for the day.</p>

<p>I know she’s not old enough to understand what’s going on around her yet, but I can’t help but to feel that hearing the words of the prayers and the Psalms at a young age is just planting another seed we’ll continue to nurture over her lifetime, doing what we can to guide her in Orthodoxy towards Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O God, our heavenly Father, who loves mankind and are a most merciful and compassionate God, have mercy upon Your handmaiden Elise for whom I humbly pray to You to care for and protect. O God, be her guide and guardian in all her endeavors, lead her in the path of Your truth, and draw her nearer to You, so that she may lead a godly and righteous life in Your love as she does Your will in all things. Give her Your grace, and mercy so that she may be patient, hard working, tireless, devout and charitable. Defend her against the assaults of the enemy, and grant her wisdom and strength to resist all temptation and corruption, and direct her in the way of Salvation, through the goodness of Your Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, and the prayers of His Holy Mother and the blessed saints. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I feel like I should get this out of the way before we get started here: I love the liturgy. I really do. I’ve been a part of a liturgical tradition for 15 years now, nearly half of my life and I honestly can’t imagine not participating liturgically in my worship of God. With that out of the way, you’ve been warned.</p>

<p>I went to a crowning service last weekend for a couple of kids who joined the Orthodox Church a few weeks ago. For the non-Orthodox here, an Orthodox wedding is like something you’ve most likely never seen. The most striking difference for most first timers is that we don’t do vows. I’ll probably delve into the reasons and rationale behind that later, but I’m trying to stay focused. Instead, we have a betrothal, crowning (with literal crowns), a procession called the Dance of Isiah and drinking from a common cup. It’s really a pretty awe-inspiring service. I studied it in my grad work and then was asked to help put together an explanation for my godson and his wife when they got married and the more I learned, the more I loved the service.</p>

<p>Back on topic, I was serving at a crowning service last weekend.  The couple had been married outside of the Orthodox Church before they joined and this was a service in which the pr</p>

<p>St. Paul tells us in the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A20-34&amp;version=ESV">the wedding epistle</a> that this is a <em>profound mystery</em>, the term we Orthodox use for Sacraments.</p>

<p>What struck me so much during the wedding, despite all of the Orthodox weddings I’ve attended, is what I <em>didn’t</em> remember, or, better stated, what didn’t jump out at me. This wasn’t a new experience for me. I gain a new perspective or new insight into what marriage means and what marriage is. As a side note and a personal soap box here, this is part of the reason I try to attend all weddings at our parish (baptisms, chrismations and funerals as well) - these are family events and we, as Christians, especially of the same parish, are a family, we are brothers and sisters in Christ and these events should be shared and celebrated  with one another, with those of us from the parish praying for the couple, the baby, the initiate or the reposed.</p>

<p>That’s the beauty of the liturgical life. When I attend a wedding, I hear the priest pray over the couple and confer God’s blessing on them. The Epistle from the service reminds us that marriage is selfless. By attending weddings at our parish, the beauty of my marriage is continually reinforced as is my role as a husband. As I’m joining the Church in praying for this new couple, I am also praying for myself, my wife and our union.</p>

<p>This is true in all of the services and mysteries of the Church. When I attend a baptism or chrismation, I relive my baptism, my chrismation. The same is true for the Epiphany/Theophany service - with the prayers of the blessing of the waters and the rememberance of Christ’s baptism, my own baptism is brought to mind. This isn’t by accident. When we relive the events in the life of Christ, of the Virigin Mary, of the Saints and of the Church, these events are reminders of salvific experiences in our lives. At the Nativity of Christ, we are reminded that we are partakers of the divine nature because of Christ’s humanity; at Transfiguration, we are called to be Transfigured; at the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross, we are reminded that we too died with Christ in the waters of baptism that we may be raised with him; at the Annunciation, we are reminded of the call to choose Christ we answered; at Pentecost, we are reminded of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on us at our Chrismation; at each and every Eucharistic service, we are reminded of the Eucharist we took when we became members of the Church. Not only are these things from the past that we remember or meditate on, they are recreative events that we participate in anew each and every time if only we are receptive.</p>

    <h2 id="a-few-thoughts-on-the-international-refugee-crisis">A Few Thoughts on the International Refugee Crisis</h2>

<p>It’s that time a year that Christmas trees and decorations adorn shop windows, Christmas songs are playing, and people everywhere are beginning the hustle and bustle of preparing for the holiday season. At the same time, I see signs around that say <strong>“Keep Christ in Christmas.”</strong> While I don’t disagree with this sentiment I find these words to be especially hollow this year and feel a little like Charlie Brown (see the header image?).</p>

<p>Watching the news, I saw a list of states that have all made an effort to ban refugees from the Middle East. And you know what caught my eye about many of these states? They are the ones that have elected officials who identify themselves as Christians. For those of you who don’t know, I’m in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the buckle of the Bible belt. Our governor professes to be a Christian as do a majority of voters in our state, yet we are trying to refuse refugees fleeing from a land torn by violence at the hands of terrorists.</p>

<p>When the angels greeted the shepherds in the fields, they proclaimed a message that Christians sing every Christmas, <em>“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</em> Are we living that good will in our lives, especially offering good will to some of the most vulnerable people, when we are turning a blind eye to our brothers and sisters in their suffering and time of need?</p>

<p>Lest we forget, Christ our Lord was a refugee. The Apostle and Evangelist Matthew tells us that after Christ was born, his mother and Joseph had to flee from Israel and make a new home in a strange land because the tyrant Herod was slaughtering innocents throughout Israel. Even after they were told they could return to Israel, they weren’t able to go home but instead made a new home in Nazareth (Matthew 2:13-23). As Christians, we are known by our love for one another and closing ourselves off from those in need is not a sign of love (John 13:35).</p>

<p>Many of these refugees are fleeing from Syria right now and several of those are our brothers and sisters in Christ. Syria was a cradle of Christian civilization in the Early Church. St. Paul had his conversion on the road to Damascus, which is in present day Syria. Christians were first called Christians in Antioch which sits on the boarder with Syria and is where St. Paul and St. Barnabas began their missionary journey. Christians in Maaloula still speak Aramaic, the language of Christ. Believers have lived in this region since the time of Christ. As I read about the sister diocese to my diocese in Bosra-Hauran in Syria, my heart breaks. The Christian population has been decimated in Syria from those fleeing the violence, abductions and enslavement of Christians at the hands of terrorist groups from within their own country. We are talking up to 2 million Christians who are suffering right now. Those are just the Christians, not counting the others caught in the middle of this conflict.</p>

<p>As we remember what happened last week, the violent attacks by a terrorist groups in Paris, it seems our media has overlooked the violence in Beirut. I’d encourage everyone to read <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elio.nicolas1/posts/1115113775167118?fref=nf&amp;pnref=story">this post</a> for some insight into those events.</p>

<p>The reaction we’re seeing within our own country and I’m reading from Christians is not one in keeping with the teachings of Christ. Let’s remember what Christ told the righteous in Matthew  35:40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of watching the news and reading articles about what companies aren’t saying, <em>“Merry Christmas,”</em> or building a defense against the <em>“War on Christmas”</em> let us watch our hearts and look at how we’re treating others who are in need, our brothers and sisters who are enduring through something so unimaginably horrific.</p>

<p>Let us also remember the words that grace the Statue of Liberty: <em>“give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.”</em> These are the people we are saying aren’t welcome here. If we are going to turn our heads and ignore the huddled masses yearning for freedom, we might as well take down Lady Liberty since she holds her lamp as a beacon. Taking Christianity out of the discussion, serving as a refuge is a part of our country, the reason for the founders of our country to come to our shores.</p>

<p>As we all make our preparations for Christmas, filling out cards, buying gifts, visiting friends and families, let us not forget what the Lord has called us to do. Let us not close our borders to those in need. Let us be vigilant and watchful for the will of the Lord so that when Christ returns, he will find us ready, like the wise virgins with their oil and the doors to the feast will not be closed to us.</p>

<p>I’m going to leave off with this beautiful prayer that I will be adding to my prayer rule during this Advent/Nativity season:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Jesus Christ, our God, You said to Your disciples, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”  We come before You in humility and ask that Your peace which surpasses all understanding will descend upon all people around the world, especially those currently in conflict and at war. Increase understanding and forgiveness between nations.  Awaken the longing for a peaceful life in all those who are filled with hatred for their neighbor.  Extinguish every dispute and banish all temptations to disagreement. Grant wisdom to civil authorities.  Free those held captive, protect those in danger, and comfort those who are suffering and displaced.  Implant in all of us reverence for You, and confirm us in love for one another.  Make us worthy to celebrate the feast of Your holy nativity and to join with the angels in chanting: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men.” For You are the King of Peace and the Savior of our souls and to You we give glory together with Your eternal Father and Your most-holy, gracious and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen</p>
</blockquote>

    <h2 id="its-just-a-christmas-song">It’s Just a Christmas Song</h2>

<p>I’ve had a few conversations with people this year about the song <em>”Mary Did You Know?”</em>  and it’s been interesting to hear how others feel about the song.  I’ve never really been a fan, namely because of how overly sentimental it feels to me, but this year I gave some thought to the meaning behind the song.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-it">So What’s Wrong With It?</h2>

<p>Okay, I’m not going to throw everything out and say that some how Mary knew each and every thing that would happen throughout Christ’s life. When songwriter Mark Lowry asks if Mary knew <em>”that your Baby Boy would one day walk on water?”</em> or <em>“that your Baby Boy will give sight to a blind man?”</em> or <em>”that your Baby Boy will calm the storm with His hand?”</em>, that’s valid theological speculation. We don’t really know if Mary knew those things. She could have been prophetic and foresaw some of those miracles that Christ would perform or maybe not, we’ll never know. But we do know that Mary had knowledge of the great power that Christ possessed as witnessed in the Gospel story of the wedding feast at Cana. When they ran out of wine for the feast, it was Mary who went to Christ to turn the water into wine.</p>

<p>Those questions aside, I do take issue with some of the other questions that songwriter Mark Lowry asks. Questions like, <em>“did you know that your Baby Boy would save our sons and daughters?”</em>, <em>“did you know that your Baby Boy has walked where angels trod? When you kiss your little Baby you kissed the face of God?”</em> These questions are outside the bound of theological speculation and land straight into a bad understanding of who Mary is and her relationship to God and her son.</p>

<p>Let’s just look at what the Archangel Gabriel told her whom he called full of Grace and pronounced the Lord was with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Luke 1:30-33.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabriel made it pretty clear who Jesus was to anyone knowledgable of the Scriptures. Since Mary was a faithful Israelite who had been taught the writings of the prophets, Mary knew what the angel meant. And these weren’t things she forgot. The nativity story in Luke tells us that <em>“Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart”</em> Luke 2:19. At Christ’s birth and as He grew, she knew He was God.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care?</h2>

<p>Mary is a saint I hold near and dear to my heart. As a young Evangelical, I dismissed the Mother of God and outright attacked her. To me, she was just another woman, nothing special, just an instrument of God. He could have chosen anyone. That’s not the whole story. Mary is a normal person, just like you and me, but she’s also so much more. She’s is extraordinary; despite the fact God <em>could</em> have chosen anyone, He didn’t - He chose Mary. She devoted herself fully to God, remained faithful to Him and gave her only son up to be crucified before her very eyes. As an aside here, I’ll make note that Mary was more faithful than 10 of the disiciples who had fled in fear from the crucifixion. She was the first Christian as she literally accepted Christ into her body. She was faithful when all hope seemed lost. She serves as an example of what faith in Christ should look like.</p>

<p>What we teach about Mary is also direct reflection of what we teach about Christ. When we call Mary the <em>Theotokos</em> (God-bearer or Mother of God), we are calling her that because Christ is both fully God and fully man. She gave birth to God through the Incarnation. We call Mary the second Eve because, just as Eve chose to sin and thus ushered death into the world, Mary said yes at the Annunciation and brought forth life into the world. We call Mary <em>“more spacious than the Heavens”</em> because she contained the God who all of creation could not contain within her womb. Just as she did during her life, everything about Mary continues to point to Christ, to call us to her Son.</p>

<p>When we diminish Mary, who she is or her knowledge of what she agreed to, we begin to diminish who Christ is. Without a doubt, Mary knew she kissed the face of God, she knew who Christ was and what His birth meant, both for her and for all of humanity.</p>

<p>With that, I join the angel and St. Elizabeth in singing,  “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.”</p>
