    <p>It’s no surprise to anyone that the New Testament writers quoted the Old Testament a lot (about 300 times); what was surprising for me to learn is how many times they used the Septuagint in the New Testament.  The Septuagint (LXX) is the Greek translation of the Old Testament which includes books that are not in the Masoratic Text, which is the Hebrew Old Testament reformers like Martin Luther looked to as more accurate.  Here are just a handful of examples of the New Testament writers quoting the Septuagint in the New Testament.</p>

<h2 id="verses-from-the-septuagint-in-the-new-testament">Verses from the Septuagint in the New Testament</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>”In John’s Gospel (Ch. 10:22) Christ the Lord mentioned the Feast of Dedication- this Feast was not mentioned in the Bible in the Protocanonica while it was proved in the Book of Maccabees that Judas Maccabeus was the first to initiate this feast when he purified the temple of the profanities of the gentiles and renewed the altar. This is a clear evidence that the Jews received the commemoration of this feast from this Book” - lacopts.org</p>
