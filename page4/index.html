    <h2 id="were-adopting">We’re adopting!</h2>

<p>That’s right, we’re really excited to grow our family through adoption this year (well, hopefully this year). We applied and have been accepted as an adoptive family at <a href="https://www.crisispregnancyoutreach.org">Crisis Pregnancy Outreach</a>. So far we’ve met our awesome mentor, had our fingerprints taken , and scheduled our home study. This is going to be an exciting journey and we’ll be blogging on <a href="http://www.thomandchristine.com">our adoption site</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most fun things we’ve done in a while is the photo shoot we had with <a href="http://www.erinwilsonphotography.com/blog/the-crowes-adoption-life-book-session-river-valley-arkansas-photographer/?utm_source=thomcrowe.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=adoption%20announcment">Erin Wilson</a> from Erin Wilson Photography. Erin is a very dear friend of ours who volunterred to come to Tulsa from her home in Clarksville, AR when <a href="http://www.weatherandnoise.com">Christine</a> told her what we were planning.</p>

<p>The road ahead is still long: we have our home study next week, we’re working on our lifebook, we have 150 volunteer hours to complete with CPO, all while we continue to pray for the birthmother who we have faith will choose us. We ask for your continued prayers for Christine and I as we embark on this journey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Last week, Christianity.com posted an <a href="http://www.christianity.com/church/worship-and-hymns/is-your-church-worship-more-pagan-than-christian.html">article</a> posing a great question, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” A friend of mine shared it on Facebook and there was a discussion about the nature and purpose of worship, but there wepre some key points that I think the article neglected.</p>

<p>First off, and I know this may be an unpopular view in modern culture, but worship isn’t about feelings. This idea of what I get out of worship or what worship has to offer me is really new on the Christian spectrum. People today go to this church or that church because they like the worship (contemporary, rock, traditional, etc).  To get more people in the door, it’s not uncommon for churches to put on what appear to me to be major concerts. Some churches go so far as to have different worship services at different times to be all things to all men.  The services are made to fit our needs and appeal to our personal preferences as opposed to being grounded in the true Christian faith. This isn’t anything new, the idea that people wanted to worship in their own way is a longstanding issue.</p>

<p>Israel was plagued throughout the Old Testament with falling short of their calling – God gave them judges, kings and prophets, yet they felt the need to be altered by the world around them, both theologically and liturgically. They had clear instructions on worship from Moses and yet still became idolatrous and worshiped a golden calf (Exodus 32). Things went south, they repented and returned to the straight and narrow. Fast forward to Jeroboam who lead Israel to sin by false worship when he introduced not just one, but two golden calfs (2 Kings 12). The Israelites wanted to worship how they felt was right and disregarded the instructions they had been given.  The worship God gave them wasn’t good enough, so they found other forms to fit their needs, other forms that made them feel good.</p>

<p>But that was Israel before Christ, it doesn’t really apply to us, does it? I mean, there aren’t churches constructing golden calfs, right?</p>

<h2 id="how-christians-worship-then--now">How Christians Worship Then &amp; Now</h2>

<p>Let’s look at Christian worship. First off, Christ tells us he didn’t come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. The Scriptures clearly in tell us that Apostles remained liturgical, they prayed the liturgical hours (Acts 2:42, 5:42, 10:2-3; 9, 16:25), kept a liturgical calendar (Acts 10:6), referred to Christ as the liturgist in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:2). The worship of the Early Church was the fulfillment of that found in Israel with the revelation of Christ, and this continued without question for 1,500 years.</p>

<p>Our worship is modeled after the worship in Heaven. Isaiah, Daniel and John all had vision of heaven that were consistent despite spanning well over a millenium. In every case there are elements of liturgical worship (incense/censors, candlesticks, responsory prayer, etc), the same worship prescribed in the Pentetuch/Torah. The book of Revelation clearly illustrates the use of altars (Rev. 6:9, 8:3, 9:13), censors and incense (5:8, 8:3), candles and candle stands (1:12, 4:5), vestments (1:13, 4:4, 6:11, 7:9-13, 15:6), scrolls – like the Gospel book in Orthodox worship – (5:2), and prostration in worship (4:10-11).</p>

<p>This is the context in which we worship, as it is in heaven, which only makes sense. The Holy Orthodox Church holds to the Traditions as handed down from the Apostles (2 Thess 2:14), which include the use of the Liturgy. That’s the beauty of Orthodoxy – I’ve attended and worshiped in parishes that didn’t speak any English, but the liturgy was the same. I was actively involved though I didn’t know any Serbian or much Greek.  If a fourth century Christian came into my parish tomorrow, he or she would recognize what is happening and feel right at home.</p>

<p>The New Testament Church was liturgical and centered in the person of Christ Jesus, as is the Orthodox Church does today. When we pray, we still pray the psalms and we still read the Old Testament Scriptures, but we read and pray with the light of Christ’s incarnation, life and resurrection. Israel worshiped on the Sabbath (Saturday), the Church worships on the Lord’s Day (Sunday). Israel had numerous sacrifices in the temple, the Church participates in the sacrifice of Christ offered once and for all each and every Sunday and feast day when we join together in the Eucharistic worship. Theophany is the Feast of Lights, Pascha is the eternal Passover, we celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, the Feast of Booths is fulfilled on Transfiguration. I could go on and with how different elements of our worship fulfill the practices of ancient Israel, but the important thing here is that the Church, in her teachings and worship, is the living the fulfillment of Israel through Jesus.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-on-christian-worship">Final Thoughts on Christian Worship</h2>

<p>So where <a href="http://wwww.christianity.com">christianity.com</a> asks, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” I think it’s important to ask “Is your church worship more worldly or heavenly?”</p>

    <h2 id="the-christian-canon---pt-2">The Christian Canon - pt 2</h2>

<p>So taking a slight detour in our journey into the Christian canon I started last week, I thought I’d write my ponderings on the Christian Old Testament.  The conversation came up recently and a friend made reference to the “Catholic books of the OT” and talked about how they added to the Bible.  Unfortunately, in the many Evangelical circles, this is the view. So here is a little on the history of the Christian Old Testament.</p>

<h3 id="christian-canon--the-septuagint">Christian Canon &amp; The Septuagint</h3>

<p>About 200 years before the time of Christ, the need arose for Jews of the Diaspora (those who found themselves, for various reasons, outside of Jerusalem) to have the Scriptures translated into a language they understood and since Greek was <i>lingua franca</i> (the language of the people), it only made sense they would be translated into Greek.  This work was called the Septuagint, a name given based on the story that 70 scholars were called together to translate the Scriptures and as the story tells, they all had the same translation. What we do know for a fact is that the Septuagint came from Alexandria and, since Greek was the language used by the people, it quickly gained favor throughout the Greek empire (and later Roman) and was used by the Jews in synagogues.  This translation was in use by the Jews for centuries and, for the Jews of Christ’s time, was a well-used and highly-favored translation of the Scriptures.  Jewish writers like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus drew heavily upon the Septuagint.</p>

<p>Now I know I’m going to digress into random interesting info that I’m not really sure adds to the discussion, but that I find interesting.  So for obvious reasons, the Jews have never called the Old Testament “Old Testament” because that would imply a New Testament or an Older Testament or something, but since they don’t have these, they have what they call the Tanakh.  This word is derived from the divisions made which are the Torah (the first five books of the Bible, or the Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy),  the Nevi’im (the Prophets: Joshua, Judges, I &amp; II Samuel, I &amp; II Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and a book that consists of what we call the minor prophets known as the book of the Twelve Prophets- Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachai ), and the Ketuvim (the writings: Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Ester, Daniel, Ezra/Nehemiah, and I &amp; II Chronicles).</p>

<p>The Jewish leaders stopped using the Septuagint sometime during the second century CE, but that means it was a valid text for the Jewish faithful for 300-500 years. One of the reasons argued for the discontinued use of the Septuagint is because it had been used so heavily by the Christians and was used in dialogue and apologetics of the Christians against Judaism. During this time it was adopted by Christians and remained the near universal text for Christians until the Protestant reformation beginning around the 1500’s, 1500 years after the death of Christ, when protestant reformers began to prefer the Hebrew manuscripts.</p>

<h3 id="the-official-christian-canon">The Official Christian Canon?</h3>

<p>If we believe as some Protestant scholars have, that the “official” translation at the time of Christ was the Hebrew, then sadly, much of the New Testament is in error as the writers quoted from the Septuagint. One great example is the St. Matthew’s use of the word <i>virgin</i> when quoting Isaiah in 1:23 when he discusses the birth of Christ; while the Hebrew manuscripts use the term “young woman” the Septuagint manuscripts say “virgin. For more, check out this &lt;a title=“<a href="http://www.oncedeliveredfaith.com/septuagint-in-the-new-testament/">Septuagint in the New Testament</a>. When Jesus is quoted by the Gospel writers, they do so in Greek, implying that not only did the Apostles consider the Septuagint valid, but Christ did also.</p>

<p>The Hebrew manuscripts used are called the Masoretic texts since they were the texts of the Masoretes who added marks above and below the text to signify the vowels and accents since Hebrew had no vowels.  This standardization occurred between the 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> centuries CE, which means, these texts were interpreted and standardized nearly a millennia after the death of Christ.  With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, we learned that in several cases of the textual differences between the more modern Hebrew manuscripts and the Septuagint, the ancient Hebrew manuscripts favored the Septuagint.</p>

<p>The New Testament writers and the Church Fathers almost unanimously used the Septuagint, yet for some reason, there exists a bias against the Septuagint, part of which comes from the fact that Septuagint contains some books called by some <em>deuterocanonical</em> (another canon -  I don’t like this term from a Christian perspective since this was part always of the OT canon of the Church) or <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Apocrypha">apocrypha</a> (literally meaning hidden or secret, again, I really do not like this term because these books were never hidden or secret).  The books in question are I &amp; II Esdras, Tobit, Judith, I, II, III, &amp; IV Maccabees, the Prayer of Manasseh, Wisdom of Solomon, the Letter of Jeremiah, Baruch, and Sirach as well as an additional Psalm, additions to Daniel (Song of the Three Holy Youths, Susanna, and Bel &amp; the Dragon), and Esther.  Origen’s <em>Hexapla</em> (the first known parallel Bible) included the Septuagint.  St. Lucien of Antioch published an addition of the Old Testament called the <em>Loukianos</em> which was in use in the fourth century in Constantinople and Antioch.  Hesychius included the books in his Old Testament used in Egypt. The Council of Hippo (393) &amp; Carthage (397) confirmed the use of these books as Scripture. Yet, some books of the Septuagint were removed from the canon by Protestant reformers who decided the Jewish canon of the 10th century was more credible than the Christian canon in use.</p>

<h3 id="the-christian-canon---the-orthodox-old-testament">The Christian Canon - The Orthodox Old Testament</h3>

<p>The Orthodox Church fortunately wasn’t confronted with Reformation movement.  To this day, the Orthodox Church uses the Septuagint as it’s Old Testament source and Canon.  This is the compilation that has been used since the time of Christ (not to mention that Christ Himself quoted!).  We have not added or taken away any books from the Old Testament, but instead keep the Old Testament as it was throughout much of the world at the time of Christ.  Our canon has not been decided upon based on what was accepted by the Jewish community after the death of Christ, but instead what was used by the Apostles and their successors.   Fortunately for us, we have the Orthodox Study Bible, released by Thomas Nelson Publishers, which is an Orthodox translation of the Septuagint, giving us an English translation of the Septuagint to use.   The Septuagint has many great lessons and stories that do provide spiritually edification and have a great deal to offer to Christians today (I myself love the <a href="[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+1&amp;version=RSVCE">Book of Tobit</a>]</p>

    <p>I thought I’d write briefly on the canon of Scripture, but, as it is with everything I do and say, it ended up being not so brief.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been drawn to reading the Scriptures much more in depth than I have in almost a decade. So I decided to listen to Ancient Faith Radio’s <a href="http://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/searchthescriptures">Search the Scriptures</a> and I’ve taken up another round of study over Genesis (which has been an obsession for me, &amp; namely the creation narratives).</p>

<p>Dr. Jeannie Constantinou really got me thinking about the canon in her podcast (which I strongly recommend). Allow me to preface by saying that it is in no way my intent to downplay the role of the Bible; you only need to attend one Orthodox service, any service, to see the importance of the Bible in our Tradition is beyond obvious. Also, this is my personal work and I do not claim to speak as an authority on Orthodoxy here, in any blog entry, or anywhere else. With that in mind, here goes.</p>

<p>Growing up I remember hearing (and saying) things like, “All I need is Jesus and my Bible. <a href="http://orthodox-apologetics.blogspot.com/2013/07/roberts-articles-on-sola-scriptura.html">Sola Scriptura</a> was so engrained in my belief system that anything else seemed ludicrous; I mean, that’s how it was for the early Christians…right?</p>

<p>Looking back, I guess I subconsciously thought once each Gospel, Epistle, Acts, and Revelation were written, they were immediately copied and given to every Church who placed a copy in the hands of all of the faithful and they took their Bibles to church, sat in pews, had some praise and worship, then listened to a sermon and they were out. I hadn’t really thought this out too well, but instead just took at face value what I had known.  The liturgical life of the early Church will be yet another topic for yet another day, but, for now, back to the canon.</p>

<p>The dating of the books of the New Testament is not something there is a strong consensus on, but the earliest estimates are that the books were begun around 40 AD and completed at the end of the 1st century (90-100AD). Even after they were written, it is impossible to think every church received every book and, even the books the various churches had, were not immediately valued as on the same level as scripture as the Old Testament books. There is of course evidence that the writings of the Apostles were soon received as inspired; for example, St. Justin Martyr’s first apology discusses the “memoirs of the Apostles” (the Gospels) being read in the Churches along with the Old Testament as early as the end of the first century.</p>

<p>The early church really did not see a need to dogmatize the writings of the Apostles into a canon and, as an aside, the first proposal for a canon came from the heretical teacher Marcion in the mid to late second century.</p>

<p>Marcion was born in Sinope and made his way to Rome where he began teaching that the Christian God and the God of the Jews (the God of the Old Testament) were, in fact, incompatible and thus not the same, but instead were two separate gods. As a result, Marcion rejected the Old Testament completely , since that was the other God, and sought to make a Gospel that followed his theological perspective. He only accepted the Gospel of Luke as authoritative (even though he edited out everything that related to the Old Testament) and 11 of the letters of St. Paul. From everything I’ve studied, this is the first attempt to form a canon of the New Testament. Despite the obvious heresy and the intent of Marcion (who set up a church hierarchy for his followers alongside the Christian hierarchy as what he believed to be the true Christianity), Marcion began a discussion about the canon.</p>

<p>St. Irenaeus of Lyons, an early Church Father and apologist, argued for the use of Four Gospels. For St. Irenaeus, the four Gospels made up a tetramorph, which literally means symbolic arrangement of four elements, illustrating a canon of the Gospels that existed by the tradition of the Church. For St. Irenaeus, the idea of the four Gospels was logical when he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*The Gospels could not possibly be either more or less in number than they are. Since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the Church is spread over all the earth, and the pillar and foundation of the Church is the gospel, and the Spirit of life, it fittingly has four pillars, everywhere breathing out incorruption and revivifying men…For the cherubim have four faces, and their faces are images of the activity of the Son of God. For the first living creature, it says, was like a lion, signifying his active and princely and royal character; the second was like an ox, showing his sacrificial and priestly order; the third had the face of a man, indicating very clearly his coming in human guise; and the fourth was like a flying eagle, making plain the giving of the Spirit who broods over the Church. Now the Gospels, in which Christ is enthroned, are like these.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the idea of the connection to Matthew and the angel, Mark and the lion, Luke and the ox, and John to the eagle comes from.</p>

<p>This entry is long enough, I think, so I’m changing the title of it to The Christian Canon, pt 1 and will continue next week.</p>
