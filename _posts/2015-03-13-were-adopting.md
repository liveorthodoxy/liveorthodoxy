## We're adopting!

That's right, we're really excited to grow our family through adoption this year (well, hopefully this year). We applied and have been accepted as an adoptive family at [Crisis Pregnancy Outreach](https://www.crisispregnancyoutreach.org). So far we've met our awesome mentor, had our fingerprints taken , and scheduled our home study. This is going to be an exciting journey and we'll be blogging on [our adoption site](http://www.thomandchristine.com).

One of the most fun things we've done in a while is the photo shoot we had with [Erin Wilson](http://www.erinwilsonphotography.com/blog/the-crowes-adoption-life-book-session-river-valley-arkansas-photographer/?utm_source=thomcrowe.com&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=adoption%20announcment) from Erin Wilson Photography. Erin is a very dear friend of ours who volunterred to come to Tulsa from her home in Clarksville, AR when [Christine](http://www.weatherandnoise.com) told her what we were planning. 

The road ahead is still long: we have our home study next week, we're working on our lifebook, we have 150 volunteer hours to complete with CPO, all while we continue to pray for the birthmother who we have faith will choose us. We ask for your continued prayers for Christine and I as we embark on this journey.
