    <p><em>Before I begin, I fully acknowledge that something like cremation may not <strong>seem</strong> to be a big theological issue - Christians today are getting cremated all the time and honored with “Celebrations of Life” instead of funerals (but that’s a topic for a whole different article) without giving it much thought. Unfortunately, it is a pretty big issue rooted in ancient heresy and a denial of basic Judeo-Christian beliefs.</em></p>

<h2 id="biblical-history-of-the-disposal-of-a-body">Biblical history of the disposal of a body</h2>
<p>Starting in Genesis, God was pretty clear with the fact that the body of someone who has fallen asleep in the Lord be buried in the earth. God told Abram (Abraham) that he would be “be buried in a good old age,” and when he died Isaac and Ishmael buried their father, just as the Lord had promised Abraham, next to Sarah (who Abraham had buried) (15:15, 29:9-10, 23:19).  The custom of burying the dead continues throughout the Old Testament: Rachel (Gen. 35:19-20). Isaac (Gen. 35:29), Jacob (Gen. 50), Joshua (Josh. 24:29-30), Eleazar (Josh 24:33), Samuel (1 Sam. 25:1) and David (1 Kings 2:10) were all buried. As a matter of fact, when Moses died, God buried him (Deut. 34:5-6). God lists among Moab’s transgressions the burning of the king of Edom’s bones to lime (Amos 2:1).</p>

<p>Let’s look at the New Testament: Christ was buried - for a few days at least -, Lazarus, John the Baptist and St. Stephen were all buried. There was definintely a pattern set in the Old Testament that carried over into the New Testament of burying the dead.</p>

<h2 id="burial-in-judaism">Burial in Judaism</h2>
<p>Before the time of Christ and to present day, Jewish custom and law does not allow for cremation.  The Talmud shows us that this was a common undertanding within Jewish culture from around the time of Christ when comments on <strong>__</strong>__, “You must bury him in entirety, not partially. From this verse we extrapolate that the command was not fulfilled if the person was partially buried (Nazir 7:1).” Judasim goes so far as to deny burial in a Jewish cemetery for someone who was voluntarily cremated and the laws of mourning are not observed! Why do they care?</p>

<p>For Jewish people, to destroy the body denies the resurrection. One is essentially casting away a body as if to say that it’s purpose is done. This is such a great offence that the Mishna teaches that anyone who denies the resurrection, will not be reunited with his or her own body (tractate Sanhedrin 10:1.).</p>

<p>In Jewish law, cremation is forbidden because of the belief that the human body belongs to God and is merely on loan to the person and it will be returned to God.  Coupling this with the belief that humanity was made in the image and likeness of God, desecrating the body, including cremation, is seen as a violation to God Himself</p>

<p>If the Jewish people care so much about the treatment of the body in the hopes of the resurrection, how much greater should we as a people care since we have seen Christ’s resurrection and participated in a foretaste of the general resurrection?</p>

<h2 id="does-it-really-matter">Does it really matter?</h2>

<p>For Christians, it definintely matters. We as Christians believe that when God created matter (the universe, the earth, plants, animals and man), it was good. Humanity was created in the image and likeness of God! Nothing else in all of creation can claim such a high station. Humanity was created body, mind (nous) and soul - this was good. Nowhere does God tell us that to seperate the body from the soul is good, but this was a consequence of the fall. Christ took on humanity, putting on flesh and becoming man, to redeem creation again after the fall, and when He raised from the dead, He was resurrected <em>bodily</em>. When He was crucified, St. Joseph of Arimathea requested His body to give it a proper burial. Our eschatatology teaches that we will be reunited with our bodies. They are not something to just burn, but instead something to take care of.</p>

<p>Not to mention, our bodies are not ours to destroy. “For do you not know…”
St. Paul prays, that our “and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and <strong>body</strong> be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Thessalonians 5:23). 9 “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 20 rfor you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body” (1 Corithians 6:19-20).</p>

<h2 id="a-pagan-and-gnostic-practice">A pagan and Gnostic practice</h2>
<p>Creamation has it’s roots in paganism, not in Judeo-Christian practices. We see cremation in places like India where it is closely aligned to a belief in reincarnation, something the Christian faith opposes. While that may not be enough to turn anyone from cremation, the Gnostic implications should be.</p>

<p>Gnosticism denies that created matter is good. Our bodies are merely shells that we are to leave behind so we can go to our higher being, as our spirit transcends the physical. It’s in Gnosticism that we see the idea that burning a body is okay because it’s just a body, but it’s not. Cremation undermines Christian ontology.  The teaching of respect for the body and burial was so important to early Christians that many risked their own lives to retrieve the body’s of martyrs. The Romans and other pagans knew this and were known to burn the bodies of martyred Christians in an attempt to destory their faith in the resurrection of hte body by rendering it impossible for resurrection. We know God is more powerful than anything that happens to our bodies and can resurrect us no matter what, but the point here is that it was a grevious insult to our forefathers and mothers of the faith to burn their bodies and now we have Chrisitians readily giving their bodies over to the inceneators and crematorium</p>

<p>The pagans, to destroy faith in the resurrection of the body, often cast the corpses of martyred Christians into the flames, fondly believing thus to render impossible the resurrection of the body.</p>

<p>Christians would lay the bodies of their loved ones in <em>coemeterium</em>, which is a Latin term that takes it’s name from the Greek word  <em>κοιμητήριον</em> which means literally “<em>sleeping place</em>.”  This term reflects the view that the early Christians had of personhood and how it relates to the body. Not to mention, as illustrated previously, the body was not, and should not be seen as something we can dispose of or destroy, because it doesn’t belog to us, but ultimately belongs to God.</p>

<p>Our bodies are precious, created and fashioned by God as part of who we are in His image and likeness. We were not made to be seperated from our bodies and will once again be reunited with them for all of eternity. Maybe they are something we should plan to give honor and respect to, even after we’ve fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Last week, Christianity.com posted an [article] (http://www.christianity.com/church/worship-and-hymns/is-your-church-worship-more-pagan-than-christian.html) posing a great question, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” A friend of mine shared it on Facebook and there was a discussion about the nature and purpose of worship, but there wepre some key points that I think the article neglected.</p>

<p>First off, and I know this may be an unpopular view in modern culture, but worship isn’t about feelings. This idea of what I get out of worship or what worship has to offer me is really new on the Christian spectrum. People today go to this church or that church because they like the worship (contemporary, rock, traditional, etc).  To get more people in the door, it’s not uncommon for churches to put on what appear to me to be major concerts. Some churches go so far as to have different worship services at different times to be all things to all men.  The services are made to fit our needs and appeal to our personal preferences as opposed to being grounded in the true Christian faith. This isn’t anything new, the idea that people wanted to worship in their own way is a longstanding issue.</p>

<p>Israel was plagued throughout the Old Testament with falling short of their calling – God gave them judges, kings and prophets, yet they felt the need to be altered by the world around them, both theologically and liturgically. They had clear instructions on worship from Moses and yet still became idolatrous and worshiped a golden calf (Exodus 32). Things went south, they repented and returned to the straight and narrow. Fast forward to Jeroboam who lead Israel to sin by false worship when he introduced not just one, but two golden calfs (2 Kings 12). The Israelites wanted to worship how they felt was right and disregarded the instructions they had been given.  The worship God gave them wasn’t good enough, so they found other forms to fit their needs, other forms that made them feel good.</p>

<p>But that was Israel before Christ, it doesn’t really apply to us, does it? I mean, there aren’t churches constructing golden calfs, right?</p>

<h2 id="how-christians-worship-then--now">How Christians Worship Then &amp; Now</h2>

<p>Let’s look at Christian worship. First off, Christ tells us he didn’t come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. The Scriptures clearly in tell us that Apostles remained liturgical, they prayed the liturgical hours (Acts 2:42, 5:42, 10:2-3; 9, 16:25), kept a liturgical calendar (Acts 10:6), referred to Christ as the liturgist in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:2). The worship of the Early Church was the fulfillment of that found in Israel with the revelation of Christ, and this continued without question for 1,500 years.</p>

<p>Our worship is modeled after the worship in Heaven. Isaiah, Daniel and John all had vision of heaven that were consistent despite spanning well over a millenium. In every case there are elements of liturgical worship (incense/censors, candlesticks, responsory prayer, etc), the same worship prescribed in the Pentetuch/Torah. The book of Revelation clearly illustrates the use of altars (Rev. 6:9, 8:3, 9:13), censors and incense (5:8, 8:3), candles and candle stands (1:12, 4:5), vestments (1:13, 4:4, 6:11, 7:9-13, 15:6), scrolls – like the Gospel book in Orthodox worship – (5:2), and prostration in worship (4:10-11).</p>

<p>This is the context in which we worship, as it is in heaven, which only makes sense. The Holy Orthodox Church holds to the Traditions as handed down from the Apostles (2 Thess 2:14), which include the use of the Liturgy. That’s the beauty of Orthodoxy – I’ve attended and worshiped in parishes that didn’t speak any English, but the liturgy was the same. I was actively involved though I didn’t know any Serbian or much Greek.  If a fourth century Christian came into my parish tomorrow, he or she would recognize what is happening and feel right at home.</p>

<p>The New Testament Church was liturgical and centered in the person of Christ Jesus, as is the Orthodox Church does today. When we pray, we still pray the psalms and we still read the Old Testament Scriptures, but we read and pray with the light of Christ’s incarnation, life and resurrection. Israel worshiped on the Sabbath (Saturday), the Church worships on the Lord’s Day (Sunday). Israel had numerous sacrifices in the temple, the Church participates in the sacrifice of Christ offered once and for all each and every Sunday and feast day when we join together in the Eucharistic worship. Theophany is the Feast of Lights, Pascha is the eternal Passover, we celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, the Feast of Booths is fulfilled on Transfiguration. I could go on and with how different elements of our worship fulfill the practices of ancient Israel, but the important thing here is that the Church, in her teachings and worship, is the living the fulfillment of Israel through Jesus.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-on-christian-worship">Final Thoughts on Christian Worship</h2>

<p>So where <a href="http://wwww.christianity.com">christianity.com</a> asks, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” I think it’s important to ask “Is your church worship more worldly or heavenly?”</p>

    <p>Things are changing, the hot days of summer are gone and people have started pulling out the sweaters and coats, more so this year than most thanks to the polar vortex that brought some lovely snow to us here in Tulsa this weekend. This weather was perfectly timed with the start of the Fast of the Nativity to get me to thinking about Christmastime and how we as Orthodox Christians engage during this time year.</p>

<p>Growing up, Christmas was my favorite time of the year. The holiday was a really BIG event in our evangelical/charismatic church. We would do a candle light service every year where we would sing hymns. This felt Christmassy to me. Then when I was in high school, I attended a candle light mass at a Catholic church with a friend and that was pretty cool too. The churches were all decorated with greenery, big nativity scenes and we had the carols. I associated all ofthese things and songs with Christmas. When I became Orthodox, I really missed the way I had celebrated Christmas growing up a lot of that and really thought out how to reconcile that celebration with my new-found Orthodox celebration.Thirteen Christmases later, I have a few thoughts on this for others who have joined the Church or are looking into it. While this was originally meant to be a single blog post, like so many other times in my life, I found myself adding more and more and more, so this week I’m going to focus on Advent and Christmas music with more to come next week.this will be continued into next week.</p>

<h2 id="advent--the-nativity-fast">Advent – the Nativity Fast</h2>
<p>Our fast in the East begins on November 15th. I personally need the fast to help me stay focused on exactly what we are preparing to celebrate. The world around us is in a frenzied state of hyped up consumerism and unchecked revelry. Even many Christians in the West forget the purpose of the season leading up to Christmas. As everyone else is spinning out of control, the fast reminds us that we need to slow down and focus on Christ. The Incarnation, God becoming man, is an universe-altering event, that we need to really stop and reflect upon. As Orthodox Christians, we fast to bring us closer to God, not because we have to,for show or to create unfair hardship. Saint Cosmas of Aitolia instructs, “Fast according to your ability, pray according to your ability, give alms according to your ability.”</p>

<h3 id="what-better-time-than-nativity">What better time than Nativity?</h3>

<p>An important part of any fast is participation in the liturgical life of the Church. We have rich hymnography and services throughout Advent. To keep everything in focus, the church gives us hymn lyrics like this: “Make ready, O Bethlehem: let the manger be prepared, let the cave show it’s welcome. The truth has come, the shadow has passed away; born of a Virgin, God has appeared to men, formed as we are and making god-like the garment He has put on. Therefore Adam is renewed with Eve, and they call out: ‘Thy good pleasure has appeared on earth to save our kind.’” It is during this time that we remember Israel awaiting the arrival of the Christ child that we know is coming in a few weeks, so that when we arrive at the great Feast, we can sing as St. Symeon the God-receiver, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” Why does this matter? St. Maximos the Greek (4th century, not to be confused with St. Maximos the Confessor) wrote, “Unless the Lord comes to us, we are completely helpless.” Without the Incarnation, without the birth of Christ, we would not have the door to salvation that has been opened to us through His glorious Resurrection.</p>

<h2 id="christmas-music">Christmas Music</h2>

<p>I love Christmas music. I really do. Like, really really love Christmas music. It was always something that was a big deal to listen to in my home growing up and the songs were always a part of church life as well, one of the few vestiges of a liturgical life left in the religious tradition in which I grew up. Over the years, I’ve listened to Western Christmas hymns and studied them to ensure what I was hearing and singing was aligned with Orthodoxy. For the most part, I was really glad to learn that they were. I’m not talking the Jingle Bells or Rudolph or Christmas Shoes songs, I’m talking the O Come, O Come Emmanuel, Angels We Have Heard on High,  God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen songs. These are amazing. O Come, O Come Emmanuel recalls the need Israel had for a savior, the need all of humanity had for Christ. O Come All Ye Faithful calls the faithful to celebrate the birth of Christ together. Away in a Manager recalls Christ’s birth (though I’d like the cave to be mentioned somewhere in there). The Little Drummer Boy gives us images of finding the Christ child in the manager. We Three Kings recalls the journey of the Magi, Kings from the East, coming to worship the Heavenly King humbled as a young babe. Others like The First Noel, Good King Wenceslas, I Saw Three Ships, Joy to the World, and O Little Town of Bethlehem are great songs to listen to and sing during the Nativity Fast as they continue to point us to Christ and the real reason for the season.</p>

<p>Others I learned to be leary of. It Came Upon a Midnight Clear was written by a Unitarian with the intent of removing the Incarnational reality from Christ’s birth and Christmas. Unitarians are quick to point out that “the Christ-child is never mentioned” because it is “ethical song, extolling the worth and splendor of peace among men.”</p>

<p>That being said, it’s so important to incorporate the beauty of the Orthodox hymnography into Christmas celebrations. I’d venture to say, it’s not possible for one to keep Christ in Christmas more than the Orthodox Church has. If you want to hear some good Orthodox Christmas music, check out the CD Make Ready, O Bethlehem by Anaphora. I can’t really let you hear it here, so I’ll just share some of the beautiful poetry in our Christmas tradition:</p>

<p><em>Christ is born! Glorify Him!
Christ descends from the heavens, welcome Him!
Christ is now on earth, O be jubilant!
Sing to the Lord, the whole earth,
And sing praises to Him with joy, O ye people,
For He has been exalted!</em></p>

<p><em>What shall we present unto Thee, O Christ,
For Thy coming to earth for us men?
Each of Thy creatures brings Thee a thank-offering:
The angels — singing; the heavens — a star;
The Wise Men — treasures; the shepherds devotion;
The earth — a cave; the desert — a manger;
But we offer Thee the Virgin-Mother. O Eternal God, have mercy upon us.</em></p>

<p>*Today doth Bethlehem receive Him
Who sitteth with the Father for ever”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I behold a strange but very glorious mystery:
Heaven — the cave;
The throne of the Cherubim — the Virgin.
The manger — the receptacle in which Christ our God,
Whom nothing can contain, is lying*</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Thy Nativity, O Christ our God,
Has illumined the world like the Light of Wisdom</em></p>

<p><em>… They who worshipped the stars were through a star,
Taught to worship Thee, the Sun of Righteousness,
And to know Thee, the Day-Spring from on high</em></p>

<p>Check back next week as we talk about decorations, festivities and other aspects of the celebration of the birth of Christ.</p>
