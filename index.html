    <h2 id="the-awe-inspiring-mystery-of-the-incarnation">The awe-inspiring mystery of the Incarnation</h2>

<p>I love Christmas, I honestly do, but I this year I find myself reflecting on what Christianity is America is losing. I’m not talking about <em>Keeping Christ in Christmas</em> or the <em>War on Christmas</em> we now hear every year, but instead of an oversimplification of the Nativity and downplaying of the Incarnation of Christ.</p>

<p>This time of year is my favorite; everyone seems a bit more cheerful, we hear words like peace, love, and joy come into more conversations, we see decorations and lights, and I love Christmas hymns. The fast forces me to slow down and contemplate what Advent means and reorients my mind to, like the Israelites of old, begin to expect Christ again, in my everyday life and for His Glorious Second Coming. Last weekend, my wife and I went to the <a href="Christmas Train">https://www.christmastrain.com/</a>, a tradition here in Tulsa put on by a local church, without daughter Ellie, the in-laws and Ellie’s godmother. While riding the train and seeing the story of salvation history and the life of Christ told over the speakers as we paced art depictions, I was left thinking of what Christmas lacks, or, more appropriately, what our observations have lost in America.</p>

<p>It would be easy to talk about the secularization of the birth of Christ, it’s hard not to notice it everywhere we go, but that’s not what I was thinking about then. It’s true that most movies we watch on TV follows a storyline where the protagonist/protagonists have a warm and fuzzy revelation at the end that Christmas isn’t about what we get or what we want, but instead is about love, family, giving, charity, sharing, etc. That’s society’s view, but the Christian world should be held to a higher standard, one that, in my general observation, isn’t happening. This is starkly contrasted to the understanding of the Church; just look at what St. Gregory of Nyssa writes on the nativity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The very Son of God, older than the ages, the invisible, the incomprehensible, the incorporeal, the beginning of beginning, the light of light, the fountain of life and immortality, the image of the archetype, the immovable seal, the perfect likeness, the definition and word of the Father: he it is who comes to his own image and takes our nature for the good of our nature, and unites himself to an intelligent soul for the good of my soul, to purify like by like.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-christmas-train">The Christmas Train</h3>

<p>The purpose of the Christmas Train is to share the greatest story ever told, right? You can see that from their website. While there, they had carolers dressed in Victorian era attire singing. What a wonderful opportunity to sing carols about Christ, carols like <em>O Come, O Come Emmanuel</em>, <em>O Holy Night</em>, <em>Joy to the World</em>, <em>We Three Kings</em> or any of the many other carols and hymns that proclaim the birth of Christ. Instead, while we were there, we heard <em>Let It Snow</em> and <em>Jingle Bells</em>. At an event that ticketed as Christian, I had expected more. The hymnography in both the Christian East and West is so rich and devotional, invoking us to set our minds on so much more, not focused on the sounds of bells on the street. I’ve heard they sing other songs as well, but this my observation, not only here, but at other predominantly Evangelical Christmas events.</p>

<p>I know that may not seem like a big deal to everyone, as I’ve heard “It’s just fun,” but something did strike me as odd and a huge deal. As we were on the train, we heard about Adam and Eve, the fall and the prophets leading up to the life of Christ. Then Christ was born, grew up, was beaten, crucified and raised again. Nowhere were we told why. The voice on the speaker said it was “for us,” but there was no reason given. Why did Christ have to die?</p>

<p>The more disturbing omission to me was the lack of any mention of the Incarnation. Christ was called the “Son of God,” but again, no context. This is something that is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. The Virgin birth is important, but Who was born is so much more crucial to understanding our relationship to God.</p>

<h3 id="the-awe-inspiring-mystery-of-the-nativity">The awe-inspiring mystery of the Nativity</h3>

<p>The Church teaches us that if Christ had not been fully God and fully man, we’d have no salvation. Christ humbled Himself from His place in Heaven, condescended as the second divine person of the Holy Trinity and the Eternal Logos took on humanity, took on flesh, took on matter so He could redeem the world. Let that sink in for a minute, even if this is something you know, honestly reflect upon that reality. God became human and, when He ascended back to Heaven, to sit at the right hand of the Father, He ascended in the flesh, taking humanity into heaven.</p>

<p>God chose Mary, a young girl to bear the God of heaven, to contain within her womb the uncontainable God who made her more spacious than the heavens and become the <em>Theotokos</em>, the Mother of God. These are important doctrinal beliefs for Christianity, not because of what they say about Mary, but because of what it ultimately means for who Christ is.</p>

<p>This was such a crucial event that the heavens were altered and offered a start to lead the Magi to Christ. The angels came in a glorious chorus to proclaim the glad tidings of Christ’s birth. What else could cause such a great cosmic disruption throughout the created universe?</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom teaches us that we should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Think not, therefore, it is of small things you are hearing, when you hear of this birth, but rouse up your mind, and straightway tremble, being told that God has come upon earth. For so marvelous was this, and beyond expectation, that because of these things the very angels formed a choir, and on behalf of the world offered up their praise for them, and the prophets from the first were amazed at this, that “He was seen upon earth, and conversed with men” (Baruch 3:37) . Yea, for it is far beyond all thought to hear that God the Unspeakable, the Unutterable, the Incomprehensible, and He that is equal to the Father, has passed through a virgin’s womb, and has vouchsafed to be born of a woman, and to have Abraham and David for forefathers.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Incarnation is a pivotal moment in salvation, and human, history. St. Maximos the Confessor puts it this way, <em>“This is the great and hidden mystery…Therefore, for Christ and in the mystery of Christ, all the ages and all things in them received their being and purpose.”</em> Everything in history was building to this point. Why? Because, according to St. Maximos, <em>“The Incarnation took place for the salvation of nature.” Without the Incarnation, we have no salvation.</em></p>

<h3 id="my-christmas-focus">My Christmas focus</h3>

<p>So here’s what Christmas means: God became man, of His own free will and out of love for humanity, as Christ and laid in the arms Mary as a helpless babe. Christ united humanity to God, not by some bridge over a cavern as we see depicted in religious tracts, but in His very person!</p>

<p>For the past couple of weeks, our priest has said, “All I want for Christmas is to love God as God loves us.” That’s my Christmas prayer, along with seeking to remain in awe of the great cosmic mystery of Christ’s birth and incarnation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Advent season is upon us. For us Orthodox Christians, we are over 2 weeks into our time to prepare for Christmas; our Nativity Fast begins 40 days before Christmas on November 15th. This year for some reason, I’ve been asked quite a few times why we fast in preparation for Christmas, which is strange because I haven’t heard that question about it in years. Since it has come up, I’ve been thinking more about the fast period and what it means to me.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point-of-the-fast">What’s the point of the Fast?</h2>

<p>We see from the Bible that fasting is pretty necessary. Before Christ began his ministry, He went to the desert and fasted and when the Apostles couldn’t exorcize the demon, Christ told them could only cast it out through prayer and fasting, just as a couple of examples. But, the fast of Moses, also for 40 days, is the basis of our Nativity fast. Before he received the commandments on Mount Sinai, Moses fasted. We also fast in anticipation of receiving from God, but, instead of commandments, we will receive the living Word of God, the second person of the Trinity, Incarnate. St. Symon of Thessaloniki explains this far better than I could dream to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The Nativity Forty-day Fast represents the fast undertaken by Moses, who—having fasted for forty days and forty nights—received the Commandments of God, written on stone tablets. And we, fasting for forty days, will reflect upon and receive from the Virgin the living Word—not written upon stone, but born, incarnate—and we will commune of His Divine Body.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our focus is shifted from the consumerism and stress that has become synonymous with the Holiday Season to focus instead on our spiritual life, preparing ourselves to receive Christ, both allegorically and quite literally through the Eucharist.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-being-anticipated">What is being anticipated?</h2>

<p>The Western Christian term of <em>Advent</em> literally means coming or arrival and sums up this time of year nicely. What does that mean? Think of it as expecting Christ in three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Historical.</em> There was a time when Israel looked forward to the Messiah when they waited for God to deliver them. We read about this longing throughout the Old Testament, throughout the Psalms, in the prophets, and the histories. It’s a common theme - Israel needed to be redeemed. During Advent, we remember this time and imagine what it was like for Israel, looking outward for hope and deliverance.</li>
  <li><em>Present.</em> We all need Christ in our lives, to enlighten our lives. Throughout the year, we greet one another by professing “Christ is in our midst,” and we reply, “He is and ever shall be.”  We know Christ is here, that we live in with Christ and Christ is with us, but there are times in our life when we feel so far from Him. So, when I sing my favorite Christmas song, “O Come, O Come Emmanuel,” I am asking for Christ to come, or, more appropriately, for me to see Him here. Remember the preparation for communion prayer of St. John Chrysostom where we pray, “As You consented to lie in a cave, in a manger of dumb beasts, so also consent to lie in the manger of my unspiritual soul and to enter my defiled body.“</li>
  <li><em>Future.</em> In some ways, we are still like the Israelites. Even though Christ took on humanity through the Incarnation and has made it possible for us to become as He is, we are still anticipating Christ’s return. As we proclaim in the Creed, we expect Christ “will come again with glory.” This is something we anticipate, we are waiting for, just as all Christians throughout the ages have. It is a part of who we are as Christians and during the fast, something we can contemplate even more than we usually do.</li>
</ol>

<p>This year, during Advent, let us anticipate Christ, remembering the anticipation of Israel for a Messiah, longing to be closer to Christ in our lives, and looking forward to His return.</p>

    <p>We Orthodox are a thankful bunch; we give thanks to God when we wake in the morning and before we go to sleep, during our hours of prayer and during the Divine Liturgy. Our whole lives are a time for us to offer thanks to God.  That doesn’t negate the fact that I love Thanksgiving, the day that we as a nation take some time to pause and reflect on the many blessings we each have.</p>

<p>This year has been a big year for us in our house and I’d like to take a few moments to share my gratitude. In February, our sweet little Elise was born, a healthy beautiful baby girl. For the past nine months, we have been blessed to watch her grow, learn and develop her personality each and every day. I’ve watched her laugh, crawl, talk, stand, wave, point and learn to make everyone around her laugh. She’s the single most precious thing in our lives, and I can’t begin to offer any thanks to God that would be worthy of the most incredible blessing I have in my life. I get to share this experience with my best friend, my beloved companion, my partner in crime, my wife. We wouldn’t have her if it weren’t for her birth mother and father, to whom we are also grateful.</p>

<p>By the grace of God, I was ordained to the holy diaconate. I am thankful every week when I stand in front and kiss of the altar and when Father George places the body of Christ in my hand. It is a great responsibility, and I thank God that I can serve our parish and the Holy Church.</p>

<p>I am blessed to have a loving and supportive family, on my side and Christine’s. Our friends and church family add to our lives and help us as we help Ellie grow up to be the amazing girl I know she will be.  They are so much more than I deserve.</p>

<p>I know we offer thanks every day, but today, I’m taking the time to share my thanks for everything God gives me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Everlasting King, Thy will for our salvation is full of power. Thy right arm controls the whole course of human life. We give Thee thanks for all Thy mercies, seen and unseen. For eternal life, for the heavenly Joys of the Kingdom which is to be. Grant mercy to us who sing Thy praise, both now and in the time to come. Glory to Thee, O God, from age to age.</em></p>

    <p>I wish I could claim originality in my inspiration for this, but I can’t. An author and blogger I follow <a href="http://blogs.ancientfaith.com/nearlyorthodox/">Angela Doll Carlson</a> shared a thought on a Facebook group we’re both a part of that caused me to pause and think - <em>“Stop talking about whether or not something is politically correct. Ask instead whether if is kind. Let’s aim for kindness.”</em> For some reason, this struck me - if we could just focus on showing kindness, how much better would things be?</p>

<h2 id="love-is-kind">Love is Kind</h2>

<p>We’re all familiar with what Christ taught in Matthew 22:36-40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is love? Among other things, it is kind, as St. Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 13. It’s something we as Christians are called to, kindness. Political correctness, in theory, centers around the idea that all people deserve respect and honor. We don’t use terms to describe people that they consider offensive, we don’t marginalize or demean someone based on their ethnicity, gender, age, intelligence, disability or other traits. And yet I count the number of times I’ve heard statements like, “I know this isn’t politically correct, but…” from Christians and non-Christians alike.</p>

<p>Angela’s post left me thinking about kindness in our everyday lives. Is it kind to discriminate, make sexist or sexual comments, to demean another person, to use terms that would offend someone? No, it most certainly isn’t. If it isn’t kind, then it isn’t love. If it isn’t love we are showing others, our neighbors, then it’s probably a safe bet to assume we are not living up to the call of Christ, we are not being strong ambassadors of Christ. I’m sure there are exceptions, but as a good rule of thumb, they go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>It’s sad that in today’s society, I see so many people espousing hateful rhetoric, racism, sexism, and childish name-calling - Christians and non-Christians alike. There is no regard for political correctness, much less kindness. As a matter of fact, the word “political” is so divisive and polarizing. This election has, in my opinion, brought out the worst in people, on both sides of the aisle, and our society has taken a step back, or perhaps opened a door that had been shut for awhile. People say hateful things; others return in kind (I have had to repent for my words over the last few months). I found encouragement in reading the words of the Elder Thaddeus who taught:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is not good when we return the love of those who love us, yet hate those who hate us. We are not on the right path if we do this. We are the sons of light and love, the sons of God, his children. As such we must have His qualities and His attributes of love, peace, and kindness towards all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, we as Christians are called to a higher standard, to be more than that which is around us and now is a great time to work together to forget political correctness and focus on what we as Christians are called to do, and that’s to show love as Christ commanded. We can be a light in the world because, as St. John of Kronstadt tells us, <em>”Evil and faults are corrected by good, by love, kindness, meekness, humility, and patience.”</em> St. Paul lays out what love is very clearly for us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>May we all look to all of our neighbors and find kindness in our hearts, offering prayers for those we agree with and those we don’t and answering the call Christ has set before us, to walk in love.</p>

    <p>I like to consider myself an amateur Orthodox apologist focusing on modern religious movements - amateur being the operative word in that sentence. When I’m traveling and I see the Jehovah’s Witnesses in a busy thoroughfare or in an airport, I always stop to pick up their newest Watchtower literature which I give a cursory read on the plane. While in Seattle a few weeks ago, I drove by the Mormon Temple and saw a group of missionaries in their perfectly pressed white shirts and ties and their Elder name badges. This got me to thinking about how we about something I don’t usually - at what we can learn from these groups and how they try to reach people.</p>

<h2 id="knock-knock">Knock knock</h2>

<p>I realized that both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses have a special passion for outreach and missionary work. This <em>should</em> seem obvious since they come to my house a few times a year and leave literature, but I had been so focused on where they were off on doctrinal issues, that I didn’t see an area where we as Orthodox Christians are missing the mark.</p>

<p>Mormon and Jehovah’s Witness members all commit to missionary work. It looks different for both groups: young Mormon men and women receive training before devoting themselves to missionary work - young men go for two years, young women for one year. They are assigned to a certain geographical area and given a partner to work with and make themselves busy going door-to-door sharing their faith. Jehovah’s Witnesses volunteer to go out in groups from their local Kingdom Halls (what they call their parishes). Some go out with friends, some with their whole family, children included. Even Prince was known to go knocking on doors in his home town of Minneapolis. What is most troubling to me, is the effectiveness these groups see from these efforts.</p>

<h2 id="and-what-do-i-do">And what do I do?</h2>

<p>While thinking on the level of commitment they give to sharing their faith, I was troubled my own personal lack of missionary mindedness for outreach and spreading the Gospel. I’m not advocating that we as Orthodox Christians need to develop hard and fast rules for going door to door throughout the world knocking and going through a rigid training program or using books with appendixes that we can flip to and give a textbook answer for any question that could come up. That’s not what Orthodoxy is about and that’s not how historical Christianity has gone about witnessing the Gospel of Christ, but I do think we need to look at the great commission we have from Christ to,”…..” and find how to live that call.</p>

<p>When is the last time you invited a friend to Church? How about a friend who isn’t religious? It’s easy for me to talk to my Evangelical friends about Holy Orthodoxy and share the fullness of the faith, but I’m not usually the best about sharing as deeply with the unchurched, the agnostics or the atheists I know. Part of this is from my background as an Evangelical where, at least in my Church, we militantly talked about Christ’s sacrifice and how our decisions here on earth affect the afterlife, without carrying the grace needed to have those conversations. That’s at least part of the reason so many people are turned off from Christianity.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-answer">So what’s the answer?</h2>
<p>In short, I don’t have a quick and easy answer, but I have some ideas we could use as a starting place for a bigger dialogue together. I know there are wonderful members of the faithful who are reaching out and would be far more suited to lead this discussion and I hope to find some who would be willing to teach the rest of us. We also have a wonderful missionary effort through groups like IOCC and men and women who give up everything and move their families to work throughout the world sharing the Gospel. But what about those of us here at home - what can we do?</p>

<h4 id="invite-friends-to-church">Invite friends to Church</h4>
<p>This seems simple enough. I try to bring many of my friends to our parish. I find services like the Pashca Rush and Liturgy, the blessing of the waters at Ephipany, feasts that don’t fall on Sundays, Vespers and Lityas to be nice intros to Orthodoxy. It’s great to bring friends, but it’s also important to prep them for their first visit.  An Orthodox service can be overwhelming, many people aren’t use to the sights, sounds and smells of Orthodoxy so a little additional time spent explaining these things is helpful. Point out examples in the Scriptures of how we worship (singing of the Psalms in Collasians 3:16 and  Ephesians 5:18-20, incense is used in Heaven throughout the book of Isiah, Daniel and Revelation, the Apostles prayed “the prayers” in Acts 10:2-3, the Early Church used a liturgical calendar as we see in Acts 20:6 and 1 Corinthians 16:8).</p>

<h4 id="pray">Pray</h4>
<p>As Christians, we are called to “pray without ceasing,” and we try to do this as we pray for friends and family, follow our daily prayer rule, remember the Jesus Prayer all throughout the day, but there are times where we can easily pray with our friends. When we are eating out at a restaurant, ask if your friends will pray with you. I have yet to have anyone object to praying for a food blessing with me. In our house, we pray before each and every meal so this isn’t unnatural for us, as it won’t be for most of you.</p>

<h4 id="visit-food-and-ethnic-festivals">Visit Food and Ethnic Festivals</h4>
<p>We have two festivals here in Tulsa, Greek Fest at Holy Trinity and Hafli at my parish, St. Antony. I <strong>love</strong> bringing friends to the festivals. It’s a fun, non-threatening way to introduce people to Holy Orthodoxy and you’re helping to support a parish since these are usually fundraisers. Check the schedule and see if there are tours that you and your friends can go one because there is always something that we can learn as well. Our priest does amazing tours and I always walk away with something new.  If there aren’t tours, or a tour time doesn’t work for you, ask if a deacon, subdeacon, reader or someone else at the parish can lead a tour or get a blessing from your priest to do a tour for your friends.</p>

<p>As an aside, our temples are powerful witnesses to Christianity and Orthodoxy. I had been reading about Orthodoxy while at college. When home for Christmas break, I visited St. George Houston and met now Khouria Gigi Shadid. My friends and I were supposed to meet with the priest but there was a miscommunication on what time we were coming, so we were blessed with a tour for Khouria Gigi. She explained the layout of the parish, the icons, the altar and how these come to life and engage Christians during worship. When I left, I told my friends I was home. I came back to college, met my now spiritual Father and told him I wanted to join the Church. These can be powerful.</p>

<h4 id="offer-to-host-an-event-or-talk">Offer to Host an Event or Talk</h4>
<p>If this doesn’t work, talk to your priest and see about doing a community event. When our bishop came to visit a few years ago, His Grace Bishop +BASIL did an enlightening talk on the Theotokos that was great for the Orthodox and non-Orthodox alike. After the movie <strong>American Sniper</strong> came out, it inspired our priest to do an amazing talk about the movie and how it applies to our spiritual life. Father George, who is a combat vet from Vietnam, talked about his experience and the work of spiritual warfare, pulling things from the movie that most of us never would have caught. We had a few talks because the community was so interested in the presentation.</p>

<h4 id="share-something-from-ancient-faith-radio">Share something from Ancient Faith Radio</h4>
<p>Here in America we are blessed to have Ancient Faith Radio. They have podcasts on almost any topic you could imagine. You can send a friend a link or download a podcast and put it on a thumb drive. Their blogs are great too. I would love it if friends would read books, but that’s a commitment and if they aren’t yet interested in Orthodoxy, that can be tough. AFR has great blogs that you can share that can be read in 5 or 10 minutes, something most people are willing to commit if you offer it to them.</p>

<h4 id="be-the-light">Be the Light</h4>

<p>We as Orthodox have a great opportunity to be the light of Christ, to show His love in our daily lives. We do this by not engaging in gossip or hateful conversations, helping those around us, praying for and with those in need, practicing Christian hospitality and countless other ways.</p>

<p>If we all try some of these, I think we could easily bring Orthodoxy to more people, sharing the faith in a practical and real way. We don’t need to engage in arguments or debates, Bible thump or anything like this. St. Paul calls us ambassadors of Christ, and this is what we are called to be, meaning we are to act as Christ, preaching and living the Gospel in love.</p>
