    <h2 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure</h2>
<p><em>I’ve wanted to write a listicle about the Orthodox Church, my home within Christianity, for quite some time. But, as often happens, I got distracted and never finished it, until today. So what changed? I saw an <a href="http://benirwin.me/2015/01/22/11-things-about-the-episcopal-church/">article</a> shared by my friend <a href="http://audreyeclectic.blogspot.com/">Heather</a> about the 11 things someone loves about the Episcopal Church. It inspired me to write this, not as a rebuttal or anything like that, but to share some of what in Orthodoxy keeps me connected to Christ, to the Church and to my brothers and sisters in Christ. That being said, thank you Ben and Heather for the inspiration and I hope I can do justice to the beauty of Orthodoxy.</em></p>

<h2 id="my-journey-to-orthodoxy">My Journey to Orthodoxy</h2>

<p>I joined the Orthodox Church almost 14 years ago after feeling lost within the Charismatic/Evangelical world. I was attending Oral Roberts University and had way too many questions to know where to even start. I had begun studying some Church History and was at a point where I was torn between Catholicism and Anglicanism, not feeling terribly comfortable with either option and my roommate was considering Messianic Judaism. The two of us were longing for something we couldn’t find and got to a point where we got a $1 loaf of french bread and bottle of grape juice to have communion in our room because we didn’t really know where we belonged.</p>

<p>Then one night, I was in someone’s dorm and saw a copy of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Eastern_Orthodox_Christianity.html?id=2B8lAQAAIAAJ">Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective</a> on his table. While I don’t recommend the book, it was enough to get me asking what Orthodox was. I did some research online, ordered a ton of books, and got everything I could from the library. The more I read, the more I felt at peace about things I’d been questioning. I prayerfully read, started attending <a href="http://www.stanontytulsa.com">my parish</a> here in town and was chrismated into the Church and I’ve never looked back. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-to-figure-it-all-out">1. I don’t have to figure it all out.</h2>

<p>On Sunday mornings, when Fr. George begins to preach his homily, I listen and take what he teaches as spiritual food and edification. I do the same thing no matter which parish I visit because priests are connected to the Apostolic Tradition. They don’t spend time trying to think up new doctrine or theological opinions, because they participate in the continuation of the preaching and teaching (the kyrgma) of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Over the past 2,000 years, there have been countless heresy that have popped up around the world and tried to make in roads into the Church. Those heresies haven’t disappeared, but keep reemerging from various groups and some of them sound appealing. Without keeping constant vigil, it’s easy for one to begin to lean on one’s understanding or get carried off on a tangent that pulls away from the faith once delivered.</p>

<p>I’ve heard so many of my friends talk about how they didn’t agree with this pastor or that speaker and I remember the days in college when guest speakers would come and I became so skeptical that I was always waiting for an ax to drop. Some people I’ve talked to have said that’s just the way it is and sometimes their pastor or a speaker says great things and sometimes it’s “Biblically unsound.” Christ warned about false teachers, St. Paul warns against teachers who talk about things contrary to what has been taught and speculating in 1 Timothy, St. John warns about false teachers…the list could go on and on.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the Church has guarded the Truth and stands as the <em>”pillar and buttress of the truth”</em> (1 Timothy 3:15). The Church has held councils as the Apostles did in Acts 15 and was led by the guidance and protection of the Holy Spirit as Christ had promised.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy--orthopraxis-go-hand-in-hand">2. Orthodoxy &amp; Orthopraxis go hand in hand.</h2>

<p>Orthodoxy has maintained, over the centuries, that it is the responsibility of the Church to preserve doctrine. Our very name is rooted in that tradition - <em>ortho</em> meaning right or correct and <em>doxa</em> meaning belief. <strong>Most</strong> Christian traditions and sects have a concept of Christian belief, but what is missing is the idea of Christian Practice, or that there is even a concept of right practice. In Orthodoxy, the two are inseparable, but throughout much of the West this is a foreign idea. There is no hesitation or question of understanding when someone says that he or she is an Observant Jew, but there exists very little concept of an Observant Christian.</p>

<p>Our faith is put into practice in our doctrine and in our lives. The two are not mutually exclusive but built upon one another. As St. James tells us, we are “justified by works and not by faith alone” because “faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (2:24; 17).</p>

<p>So what does that look like? Within the Church, we <em>“stand firm and hold to the traditions</em>” that were delivered by the Apostles, <em>”either by spoken word or by our letter”</em> (2 Thessalonians 2:15). We are baptized for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, when we gather on the Lord’s Day, we participate in the Eucharist, we recieve the gift of confession, we celebrate together, we fast together, we mourn together…we work as one body of Christ.</p>

<p>In our every day lives, we are called to holiness, which we often miss. My praxis is challenged when I stand before the icon of Christ and confess our sins to Him in the presence of my priest and spiritual father who councils me and confirms God’s forgiveness.</p>

<h2 id="we-worship-with-our-whole-being">3. We worship with our whole being.</h2>

<p>Orthodox worship engages all of the senses, taking worship out of a theoretical place, and grounding it here, in something tangible. We cross ourselves, offer metenias, prostrate, process - all forms of worship involving movement, engaging our bodies. As we look around, we are surrounded by the icons of Christ and His saints, we hear the chanting and the bells, we smell the incense, we taste the fountain of immortality in the Eucharist - our whole person is engaged in worship, as it should be because, after all, when God created us He said, “It is good.”</p>

<p>Our senses being engaged in worship speaks to our view of humankind - we are not evil. Our bodies are not evil. We weren’t created to die, the separation of body and soul is a consequence of the fall, not part of God’s design. Our free will separates us, but it was Christ’s incarnation, a good and loving Christ who put on humanity, that redeemed the material world.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-is-connected">4. Orthodoxy is connected.</h2>

<p>When I go to an Orthodox Church, I know what to expect. Every Orthodox Church, throughout the entire world will be participating in the same liturgy I am. I am part of something much larger, part of communities of people I’ve never met with languages and cultural customs I know nothing about. A few years ago, I visited a Serbian parish that was near my parents. I <em>should</em> have done my research, but I didn’t and when I got there the entire liturgy was in Serbian. Despite the fact that I obviously don’t understand more than a couple of Serbian words, I was actively involed in the liturgy. I knew what the priest was saying, I knew what the chanters were chanting and I was able to participate in this glorious service, commune and fellowship with my brothers and sisters in Christ after service.</p>

<p>But the connection is deeper - as I look at the icons on the walls, I am connected with those saints. I am praying the same prayers they prayed, I am singing the same hymns they sang, I am receiving the same Eucharist they received. We are connected as the Church militant in a very real way to the Church invisible because,  <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews+12/">“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-begin-or-end-liturgy-we-merely-join-in">5. We don’t begin or end liturgy, we merely join in.</h2>

<p>The Bible shows us insights into Heaven. In Isaiah, Daniel and St. John’s Apocolypse we see liturgical clothing, prayers and responses, censors and incense, lamps and lamp stands, candles, etc. There is an eternal liturgy taking place before the throne of God with angels and saints crying out to God. When we go to church, our services don’t begin and end, but we join into the prayers of the saints. We can again boldly confess that <em>“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses”</em>.</p>

<p>Recently we celebrated the Feast of All Saints. During Vespers we read, <em>“As is meet let us acclaim with sacred songs and laudations the divine assembly of the Apostles, Martyrs, and godly-minded priests, and the women most chaste, who throughout the whole world have contested in unshaken faith. For, though they were of earth, they were all united together with the Bodiless of Heaven’s heights, and by their august passion they received most blessed dispassion through Christ God’s grace. And now like steadfast stars that shine upon us, they intercede * with great boldness for our souls.”</em> It is a beautiful feast that reminds us that the Church militant is not removed from the Church invisible, we share the same Great High Priest in Christ Jesus, the same joy in the hope of the resurrection, and the same prayers for the world and all of humanity.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-embraces-mystery">6. Orthodoxy embraces Mystery.</h2>

<p>As an Orthodox Christian, I don’t have to try to explain everything. I know that God is bigger than I am and that my ways truly are not His ways. I know that at some point this saying has become a cliche in the West and, as my friend Jeff Huston pointed out, if you would have asked either of us in our pre-Orthodox days if we believed that, we would have said yes without question.</p>

<p>Now that we’re Orthodox, it means something…more. In Orthodoxy, we don’t spend our time reading and studying, trying to find a dogmatic reason for things. We don’t have to explain everything, but leave it to mystery. Take the Eucharist for example. We don’t have a doctrine of Transubstantiation or try to explain how the bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ; we know this to be true and it happens by some Divine Mystery.  As a matter of fact, what are called Sacraments in the West are called Mysteries in the East!</p>

<p>When I was working on my graduate studies, we spent a great deal of time reading about the unknowability of God. There’s an apophatic approach to describing God. Any terms or attributes that we can ascribe to God are limited and fall short, so we describe what God isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-and-individual-worship-is-a-part-of-the-christian-life">7. Corporate and individual worship is a part of the Christian life.</h2>
<p>I’ve heard so many people place emphasis on worship and devotion to God being an individual act and, to a degree, I can get on board. I pray to God, I read the Scriptures and writings of the Church Fathers, and try to sit in the stillness seeking God as all Orthodox Christians are called to do.</p>

<p>When we go to church, all of our Orthodox Churches are all laid out the same - we walk into the narthex, enter into the nave and face the altar. The nave is like a ship carrying us all on the journey of life and faith towards Heaven. We participate in the Liturgy together, which, as its very name implies is the work of the people. We are saved both individually and as a community.</p>

<h2 id="confession-is-freeing">8. Confession is freeing.</h2>
<p>I have a spiritual father, not just a priest, but someone who knows me inside and out, all of my deepest darkest secrets who helps me navigate through the Christian life. After I’ve prayerfully prepared for Confession, I go to our parish and stand with my priest before the icon of Christ at the front of our parish. As I confess, I make my confession to Christ and sometimes I’m granted the freeing tears of repentance. Once I’ve finished, Fr. George confirms Christ’s forgiveness and the remission of sins. But that’s not all, he counsels me with spiritual wisdom that helps me grow in Christ. The Church, through confession, helps us to rise up and become who we are supposed to be in Christ. We are conformed to the image and likeness of Christ. After I confess, I feel free. The sins that I’ve committed, both out in the open and those that I think have been done in secret, once confessed, lose their hold on me. I no longer feel the weight of guilt, but instead know that I can be more than who I am.</p>

<p>Not only is it freeing, it is Biblical. One of Christ’s final things Christ bestowed to His Disciples was the authority to forgive sins in Heaven and on earth. We believe the Bible to be inspired and have faith in the work of Christ. That authority to confirm the remission of sins is a great gift that far too many people have thrown aside.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgical-calendar-is-a-calendar-for-our-lives">9. The liturgical calendar is a calendar for our lives.</h2>
<p>I always loved Christmas - the decorations, the Christmas music we sang in Church, the reading of the Nativity story. Now I love the rest of the events in Christ’s life, along with the events of the Early Church as well lives of the Theotokos and saints and major events in the life of the Church throughout history. The Israelites remembered important days in which God intervened and helped them as Feast Days, days Christ and the Apostles kept.</p>

<p>We celebrated Pascha (Easter) a few months ago, and every day we were reminded that we are in the Paschal season. During the Paschal Season, I find myself singing the Paschal troparion - <em>Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!</em> - and the Paschal antiphons, I greet other members of the Church by saying <em>“Christ is Risen”</em>, and look forward to seeing the Paschal candle every week at Church. After 40 days, we celebrated the Ascension, followed by Pentecost in another 10 days. August 6th is Transfiguration, the Church New Year is September 1st, the Nativity of the Theotokos follows on September 8th, then the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross on September 14th…you get the idea. Plus we celebrate our family members’ (and friends’) patron saint days (or, as we call them, name days). Our year revolves around the Church year. We fast, feast and celebrate together. We have customs and traditions in our parish and at our home. It brings our life in Christ and the life of the Church into our every day in a whole new, yet ancient, way.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-conforms-us-we-dont-conform-it">10. The Church conforms us, we don’t conform it.</h2>

<p>During the Civil Rights march in Selma, Archbishop Demetrius marched and stood next to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights movement didn’t alter the Church or change the Church, but the Civil Rights movement was rooted in the unchanging truths evident within the Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy doesn’t change every few decades depending on how society changes, but remains a true and steady witness to Christ throughout history.</p>

<p>We are called to holiness and the standard or measure of holiness is not something that is subjective or something that changes day to day. As things change or public opinion falters, the Church doesn’t change. Instead, we are called to change, as it should be. There is an idea today that we hold God to humanly standards and conform Him to our own image or ideals - instead we are still in a world in which we are ever changed and molded into God’s image.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgy-becomes-a-part-of-you">11. The liturgy becomes a part of you.</h2>

<p>I never would have believed it at the time, but looking back, I can see that the churches I grew up in had their own liturgy. You go to church, there was upbeat fun music, it would slow down, the pastor would preach for 40 minutes, the lights would go down and slow music would start playing. It happened every week. While at ORU, I learned that there were formulas for this.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the liturgy we use is tried and true - most Sundays we pray the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a liturgy that has been used by the Church since the 4th century!</p>

<p>Liturgy guides us, it serves as a beacon in a storm-tossed world  that ensures we are oriented in the right direction and keeps our focus aimed for the Kingdom of God, not just some far off place, but helps us find the Kingdom that is within us.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-knows-what-we-need-when-we-dont">12. The Church knows what we need when we don’t.</h2>

<p>Last week, a good friend of mine, our parish chanter, fell in asleep in the Lord. It was fairly sudden and caught me by surprise. While he was in the hospital, on life support, and I went to Vespers for All Saints. The readings were so aptly timed - (Isaiah 43:9-14, Wisdom of Solomon 3:1-9 &amp; Wisdom of Solomon 5:15-6:3). It was comforting to hear the encouragement about the saints. After that, I went with my priest when he prayed the prayers for the departing of the soul from the body. It was emotional and I was lost. I didn’t know what to think, much less what to pray. He fell asleep later that evening. Then when I was at home, I was able to turn to the prayers of the Church which gave me comfort. Then, the following morning, we held a prayer service (Trisagian) for him. The Church was there to give us what we needed.</p>

<p>The same is true of things like fasting. A mother gives her child the medicine he or she needs. I think we can all remember a time from childhood when we were sick and our mom gave us something that didn’t taste very good, but, in the end, it made us better.  The same is true for the Church. When I started in a prescribed fast, it was odd. At first, it was a challenge to overcome, I guess you could say I gamified fasting - if I do this, this, and this I win fasting. Then it was something I didn’t do for a long time or I would look for loopholes around fasting. But, when I started fasting, as tough as it was, it began to make sense. I had to put in the effort that the Church prescribed before I could understand the richness that is set there for usx by Christ.</p>

<p>The same is true of so many aspects of our lives - our services, our readings, our icons, confession, fasting, the lives of the saints - I could go on and on. The Church, as the body of Christ, is the great hospital for us on earth and is here to take care of us, even if we don’t know what we need.</p>

<p>I know some of these things may not sound earth shattering, but believe me it is. It’s different within Orthodoxy, it’s healing, it helps us to become whole, it continues the work of Christ in restoring humanity through the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>It’s interesting for me to look at the world around me as we approach the Great Feasts and note how so few people I know observe these Feasts of the Christian faith (save Christmas and, for some, Easter). Growing up, I had never really heard of the Feast of Pentecost as a Christian celebration, it was a foreign concept to me after I joined the Church and now it serves as one of my favorite feasts of the year. Of course I had read about Pentecost, growing up Charismatic, Acts 2 was a pretty popular read, but I didn’t really know that it was celebrated throughout the Christian world much as Christmas had been, and the Jewish feasts of the Old Testament. I grew up Charismatic so Pentecost was a defense for speaking in tongues (not an issue I’m going to delve into, suffice to say, my interpretation of this is dramatically different now), but it’s place as an actual feast recognized every year 50 days after Pascha (Easter) was not there, so I thought I’d share a little on the traditional understanding of the Feast of Pentecost.</p>

<p>From the Old Testament, Pentecost, which means 50th day, was an agricultural feast that occurred 50 days after Pascha (Passover) and is known by the Jewish faithful as the Feast of the First Fruits, or Shavuot. While an agricultural feast (the end of the harvest season), it is also associated with God giving Moses the 10 Commandments on Mount Sinai. For Christians, Pentecost is the beginning of the ministry of the Apostles. In the upper room, the Apostles (and Mary) sat faithfully waiting as Christ had commanded the arrival of the Holy Spirit. This time, when God meets man, instead of bringing stone tablets written with fire, the fire rested upon the heads of the Holy Apostles and they preached Christ to all who were present. Mount Sinai and the tablets given to Moses foreshadowed what was now fulfilled with the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-pentecost">Why Do We Need Pentecost</h2>

<p>We as Christians also see this as a reversal of the Tower of Babel. People decided that they were not content to rule over the earth, but pride led them to want to acquire heaven by force. They built a tower to reach God and, in turn, God confused the tongues of man. On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit unites humanity together again by the gift of tongues. The hymnography of the Church clearly illustrates this: Of old there was confusion of tongues because of the boldness of the tower-builders. But those tongues have not uttered wisdom for the glory of divine knowledge. There God condemned the infidels to punishment, and here with the Spirit Christ illuminated the fishermen. At that time, the confusion of tongues was designed for vengeance, and now the unison of tongues hath been renewed for the salvation of our souls. – the Doxasticon of Pentecost When the High One descended, confusing tongues, He divided the nations. And when He distributed the fiery tongues He called all to one unity. Wherefore, in unison we glorify the most Holy Spirit. – the Kontakion of Pentecost. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_Dmitri_Royster">Archbishop +DMITRI</a> (memory eternal) wrote in his <a href="http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/62291.htm">article on Pentecost</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What happened on that fiftieth day after our Lord’s resurrection was the filling of the disciples with the Holy Spirit, their transformation into the Church. Pentecost is the day of the Church’s founding. From this point in time the disciples were empowered to do what our Lord told them: ‘As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.’” (John 20:21).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pentecost Icon And at Orthros we sing: The spring of the Spirit hath come to those on earth, dividing noetically into fire-bearing rivers, moistening the Apostles and illuminating them. The fire hath become to them a dewy cloud, lighting, and raining flames upon them, from whom we received grace by the fire and the water. Verily the fire of the Comforter hath come and lighted the world. In the Orthodox Church, we switch all of the liturgical colors (vestments, altar cloths, candles, etc) from the joyous white of Pascha, to a green, clearly connecting to the Jewish celebration of Pentecost, as its fulfillment.</p>

<h2 id="pentecost-in-the-life-of-the-church">Pentecost in the Life of the Church</h2>

<p>Pentecost is the third of the “Big Three” feasts if you will: on Christmas, God becomes incarnate, humbles Himself takes on humanity with the intent of redeeming creation; on Pascha, God defeats the ultimate enemy of death for us, defeating death by death and restoring humanity to it’s original state through His glorious resurrection; on Pentecost, the third Person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit descends and gives us what we as followers of Christ need to become perfect. <a href="http://www.stmarysgoc.org/fr-anthony-coniaris/">Fr. Anthony Coniaris</a> quotes St. Seraphim of Sarov in his article <a href="http://www.theologic.com/oflweb/inhome/pcost.htm">How To Celebrate Pentecost</a> at Home by saying :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Prayer, fasting, vigils and all other Christian acts, however good they may be in themselves, certainly do not constitute the aim of our Christian life; they are but the indispensable means of attaining that aim. For the true aim of the Christian life is the acquisition of the Holy Spirit of God. As for fasts, vigils, prayer and almsgiving, and other good works done in the name of Christ, they are only the means of acquiring the Holy Spirit of God.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Let us, O believers, celebrate with joy the last Feast, which is also the last of the Feast—Pentecost—which is the end and fulfillment of the preordained promise; for then did come down the fire of the Comforter upon the earth in the likeness of tongues, lighting the Disciples and revealing them plainly as initiates of heavenly things. Verily, the light of the Comforter hath come and lighted the world” – Kathismata from Orthros. With that in mind, let us begin again to pray: O heavenly King, the Comforter, Spirit of Truth, Who art in all places, and fillest all things, Treasury of good things, and Giver of life, come, and dwell in us, and cleanse us from every stain; and save our souls, O good One.”</p>

    <p>Septuagint in the New Testament</p>

<p>It’s no surprise to anyone that the New Testament writers quoted the Old Testament a lot (about 300 times); what was surprising for me to learn is how many times they used the Septuagint in the New Testament.  The Septuagint (LXX) is the Greek translation of the Old Testament which includes books that are not in the Masoratic Text, which is the Hebrew Old Testament reformers like Martin Luther looked to as more accurate.  Here are just a handful of examples of the New Testament writers quoting the Septuagint in the New Testament.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”In John’s Gospel (Ch. 10:22) Christ the Lord mentioned the Feast of Dedication- this Feast was not mentioned in the Bible in the Protocanonica while it was proved in the Book of Maccabees that Judas Maccabeus was the first to initiate this feast when he purified the temple of the profanities of the gentiles and renewed the altar. This is a clear evidence that the Jews received the commemoration of this feast from this Book” - lacopts.org</p>

    <p><em>Before I begin, I fully acknowledge that something like cremation may not <strong>seem</strong> to be a big theological issue - Christians today are getting cremated all the time and honored with “Celebrations of Life” instead of funerals (but that’s a topic for a whole different article) without giving it much thought. Unfortunately, it is a pretty big issue rooted in ancient heresy and a denial of basic Judeo-Christian beliefs.</em></p>

<h2 id="biblical-history-of-the-disposal-of-a-body">Biblical history of the disposal of a body</h2>
<p>Starting in Genesis, God was pretty clear with the fact that the body of someone who has fallen asleep in the Lord be buried in the earth. God told Abram (Abraham) that he would be “be buried in a good old age,” and when he died Isaac and Ishmael buried their father, just as the Lord had promised Abraham, next to Sarah (who Abraham had buried) (15:15, 29:9-10, 23:19).  The custom of burying the dead continues throughout the Old Testament: Rachel (Gen. 35:19-20). Isaac (Gen. 35:29), Jacob (Gen. 50), Joshua (Josh. 24:29-30), Eleazar (Josh 24:33), Samuel (1 Sam. 25:1) and David (1 Kings 2:10) were all buried. As a matter of fact, when Moses died, God buried him (Deut. 34:5-6). God lists among Moab’s transgressions the burning of the king of Edom’s bones to lime (Amos 2:1).</p>

<p>Let’s look at the New Testament: Christ was buried - for a few days at least -, Lazarus, John the Baptist and St. Stephen were all buried. There was definintely a pattern set in the Old Testament that carried over into the New Testament of burying the dead.</p>

<h2 id="burial-in-judaism">Burial in Judaism</h2>
<p>Before the time of Christ and to present day, Jewish custom and law does not allow for cremation.  The Talmud shows us that this was a common undertanding within Jewish culture from around the time of Christ when comments on the Torah, “You must bury him in entirety, not partially. From this verse we extrapolate that the command was not fulfilled if the person was partially buried (Nazir 7:1).” Judasim goes so far as to deny burial in a Jewish cemetery for someone who was voluntarily cremated and the laws of mourning are not observed! Why do they care?</p>

<p>For Jewish people, to destroy the body denies the resurrection. One is essentially casting away a body as if to say that it’s purpose is done. This is such a great offence that the Mishna teaches that anyone who denies the resurrection, will not be reunited with his or her own body (tractate Sanhedrin 10:1.).</p>

<p>In Jewish law, cremation is forbidden because of the belief that the human body belongs to God and is merely on loan to the person and it will be returned to God.  Coupling this with the belief that humanity was made in the image and likeness of God, desecrating the body, including cremation, is seen as a violation to God Himself</p>

<p>If the Jewish people care so much about the treatment of the body in the hopes of the resurrection, how much greater should we as a people care since we have seen Christ’s resurrection and participated in a foretaste of the general resurrection?</p>

<h2 id="does-it-really-matter">Does it really matter?</h2>

<p>For Christians, it definintely matters. We as Christians believe that when God created matter (the universe, the earth, plants, animals and man), it was good. Humanity was created in the image and likeness of God! Nothing else in all of creation can claim such a high station. Humanity was created body, mind (nous) and soul - this was good. Nowhere does God tell us that to seperate the body from the soul is good, but this was a consequence of the fall. Christ took on humanity, putting on flesh and becoming man, to redeem creation again after the fall, and when He raised from the dead, He was resurrected <em>bodily</em>. When He was crucified, St. Joseph of Arimathea requested His body to give it a proper burial. Our eschatatology teaches that we will be reunited with our bodies. They are not something to just burn, but instead something to take care of.</p>

<p>Not to mention, our bodies are not ours to destroy. “For do you not know…”
St. Paul prays, that our “and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and <strong>body</strong> be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (I Thessalonians 5:23). 9 “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, 20 rfor you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body” (1 Corithians 6:19-20).</p>

<h2 id="a-pagan-and-gnostic-practice">A pagan and Gnostic practice</h2>
<p>Creamation has it’s roots in paganism, not in Judeo-Christian practices. We see cremation in places like India where it is closely aligned to a belief in reincarnation, something the Christian faith opposes. While that may not be enough to turn anyone from cremation, the Gnostic implications should be.</p>

<p>Gnosticism denies that created matter is good. Our bodies are merely shells that we are to leave behind so we can go to our higher being, as our spirit transcends the physical. It’s in Gnosticism that we see the idea that burning a body is okay because it’s just a body, but it’s not. Cremation undermines Christian ontology.  The teaching of respect for the body and burial was so important to early Christians that many risked their own lives to retrieve the body’s of martyrs. The Romans and other pagans knew this and were known to burn the bodies of martyred Christians in an attempt to destory their faith in the resurrection of hte body by rendering it impossible for resurrection. We know God is more powerful than anything that happens to our bodies and can resurrect us no matter what, but the point here is that it was a grevious insult to our forefathers and mothers of the faith to burn their bodies and now we have Chrisitians readily giving their bodies over to the inceneators and crematorium</p>

<p>The pagans, to destroy faith in the resurrection of the body, often cast the corpses of martyred Christians into the flames, fondly believing thus to render impossible the resurrection of the body.</p>

<p>Christians would lay the bodies of their loved ones in <em>coemeterium</em>, which is a Latin term that takes it’s name from the Greek word  <em>κοιμητήριον</em> which means literally “<em>sleeping place</em>.”  This term reflects the view that the early Christians had of personhood and how it relates to the body. Not to mention, as illustrated previously, the body was not, and should not be seen as something we can dispose of or destroy, because it doesn’t belog to us, but ultimately belongs to God.</p>

<p>Our bodies are precious, created and fashioned by God as part of who we are in His image and likeness. We were not made to be seperated from our bodies and will once again be reunited with them for all of eternity. Maybe they are something we should plan to give honor and respect to, even after we’ve fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection.</p>

    <p>Last week, Christianity.com posted an <a href="http://www.christianity.com/church/worship-and-hymns/is-your-church-worship-more-pagan-than-christian.html">article</a> posing a great question, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” A friend of mine shared it on Facebook and there was a discussion about the nature and purpose of worship, but there wepre some key points that I think the article neglected.</p>

<p>First off, and I know this may be an unpopular view in modern culture, but worship isn’t about feelings. This idea of what I get out of worship or what worship has to offer me is really new on the Christian spectrum. People today go to this church or that church because they like the worship (contemporary, rock, traditional, etc).  To get more people in the door, it’s not uncommon for churches to put on what appear to me to be major concerts. Some churches go so far as to have different worship services at different times to be all things to all men.  The services are made to fit our needs and appeal to our personal preferences as opposed to being grounded in the true Christian faith. This isn’t anything new, the idea that people wanted to worship in their own way is a longstanding issue.</p>

<p>Israel was plagued throughout the Old Testament with falling short of their calling – God gave them judges, kings and prophets, yet they felt the need to be altered by the world around them, both theologically and liturgically. They had clear instructions on worship from Moses and yet still became idolatrous and worshiped a golden calf (Exodus 32). Things went south, they repented and returned to the straight and narrow. Fast forward to Jeroboam who lead Israel to sin by false worship when he introduced not just one, but two golden calfs (2 Kings 12). The Israelites wanted to worship how they felt was right and disregarded the instructions they had been given.  The worship God gave them wasn’t good enough, so they found other forms to fit their needs, other forms that made them feel good.</p>

<p>But that was Israel before Christ, it doesn’t really apply to us, does it? I mean, there aren’t churches constructing golden calfs, right?</p>

<h2 id="how-christians-worship-then--now">How Christians Worship Then &amp; Now</h2>

<p>Let’s look at Christian worship. First off, Christ tells us he didn’t come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. The Scriptures clearly in tell us that Apostles remained liturgical, they prayed the liturgical hours (Acts 2:42, 5:42, 10:2-3; 9, 16:25), kept a liturgical calendar (Acts 10:6), referred to Christ as the liturgist in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:2). The worship of the Early Church was the fulfillment of that found in Israel with the revelation of Christ, and this continued without question for 1,500 years.</p>

<p>Our worship is modeled after the worship in Heaven. Isaiah, Daniel and John all had vision of heaven that were consistent despite spanning well over a millenium. In every case there are elements of liturgical worship (incense/censors, candlesticks, responsory prayer, etc), the same worship prescribed in the Pentetuch/Torah. The book of Revelation clearly illustrates the use of altars (Rev. 6:9, 8:3, 9:13), censors and incense (5:8, 8:3), candles and candle stands (1:12, 4:5), vestments (1:13, 4:4, 6:11, 7:9-13, 15:6), scrolls – like the Gospel book in Orthodox worship – (5:2), and prostration in worship (4:10-11).</p>

<p>This is the context in which we worship, as it is in heaven, which only makes sense. The Holy Orthodox Church holds to the Traditions as handed down from the Apostles (2 Thess 2:14), which include the use of the Liturgy. That’s the beauty of Orthodoxy – I’ve attended and worshiped in parishes that didn’t speak any English, but the liturgy was the same. I was actively involved though I didn’t know any Serbian or much Greek.  If a fourth century Christian came into my parish tomorrow, he or she would recognize what is happening and feel right at home.</p>

<p>The New Testament Church was liturgical and centered in the person of Christ Jesus, as is the Orthodox Church does today. When we pray, we still pray the psalms and we still read the Old Testament Scriptures, but we read and pray with the light of Christ’s incarnation, life and resurrection. Israel worshiped on the Sabbath (Saturday), the Church worships on the Lord’s Day (Sunday). Israel had numerous sacrifices in the temple, the Church participates in the sacrifice of Christ offered once and for all each and every Sunday and feast day when we join together in the Eucharistic worship. Theophany is the Feast of Lights, Pascha is the eternal Passover, we celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, the Feast of Booths is fulfilled on Transfiguration. I could go on and with how different elements of our worship fulfill the practices of ancient Israel, but the important thing here is that the Church, in her teachings and worship, is the living the fulfillment of Israel through Jesus.</p>

<p>So where <a href="http://wwww.christianity.com">christianity.com</a> asks, “Is your church worship more pagan than Christian?” I think it’s important to ask “Is your church worship more worldly or heavenly?”</p>
