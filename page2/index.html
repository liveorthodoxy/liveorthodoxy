  <p><em>TL:DR- Doctrine matters. It’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings. This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-who-do-you-say-that-i-am---mark-829">“But who do you say that I am?” - Mark 8:29</h2>
<p>When Jesus asked this question to the Apostle Peter nearly 2,000 years ago, he asked a question that would need to be answered by each and every person who would come in contact with the Gospel. As Christianity spread, and the number of those who professed a faith in Christ grew, the number of interpretations of that question also grew, some times to the detriment of believers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-creed">What is a Creed?</h2>
<p>Creed comes from the Latin word <em>credo</em> meaning “to believe.”  I know for many Protestants, the term Creed is far too restrictive and formal, so they’ve developed their own statements of belief or confession of faith; despite what it may be called, it is ultimately a Creed.  For the Orthodox Church, no Creed is more widely expressed than the Nicene Creed (sometimes called the Nicene-Constantinople Creed).</p>

<p>Creeds are not unique to Christianity; Judaism professes the <em><strong>Shema Yisrael</strong></em> (<em>“Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</em> Deuteronomy 6:4) and Islam professes their creed, the shahada which says, <em>“There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God.”</em></p>

<h2 id="creeds-in-the-new-testament">Creeds in the New Testament</h2>

<p>In the early Church, there were simple creeds that addressed the problems that faced the various Churches. A great example is what is referred to as the <em>Pre-Pauline Creed</em> of 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 which says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <strong>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</strong> (English Standard Version).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s called the Pre-Pauline Creed because it is a creed that Paul is obviously quoting, which existed before he was converted as we see from his statement, “which I also received” in verse 3.</p>

<p>St. Paul again quotes part of an early creed when he writes to St. Timothy 3:16, <em>”We confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.”</em></p>

<p>All of these are a continual development of the Church answering Christ’s question, “Who do you say that I am?”</p>

<h2 id="the-creed-of-the-early-church">The Creed of the Early Church</h2>
<p>Just as the different New Testament communities developed creeds to ensure safe guards around correct teaching, the Early Church had issues that arose and they too needed to define doctrine.  The most well known Creed in Christendom is the Nicene Creed.  In the fourth century, a doctrine was spreading that denied Christ’s divine nature called Arianism. This doctrine threatened the sound Christian doctrine and our understanding of who Christ is.  The leaders of the Church came together in the city of Nicea and all 318 successors to the Apostles unanimously agreed on a formula to articulate the person of Christ.  This formula became the Nicene Creed.  The faithful members of the Church affirm this belief regularly to safe guard against false teaching.  The beauty of the Creed is best explained by the late Yale professor, Dr. Jaroslav Pelikan who said, <em>”The singing of the creed is a very important and cherished way of indicating a universality of the faith across not only space but time — to know that in the Philippines this morning, this was the creed that was recited and to know that the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century and my late father and grandfather all affirmed this, all of us together.”</em></p>

<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>There’s this idea of unity between several strains of Christianity that exists outside of doctrine. It seems to me that there’s laissez-faire attitude towards doctrine and belief, that an understanding of the nature of God, man, salvation, etc is of less importance than a semblance of unity.</p>

<p>Sadly, I’ve heard several Christians say they are Christians because of a unique experience or a feeling they get. I’m not going to say that there’s no place for personal feelings or experience within Christianity, but instead that it isn’t all we need.  Those of other faiths heavily draw on the emotions and personal experiences.  Take for examples the Latter-Day Saint (Mormon) missionaries. When they begin visiting with non-LDS about the LDS Church, they cite from their Doctrine &amp; Covenants (one of their books of scripture along with the Bible, Book of Mormon and Articles of Faith) and claim Christ said <em>”But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right <strong>I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right</strong>.”</em> (D&amp;C 9:8)  When talking to someone who joins the LDS church, they will confirm the burning in the bosom as their proof of faith. When faith and truth are based primarily on experience, how does one question the validity of something like this? People join the LDS church despite the fact that they teach things outside of the Nicene Creed and historical Christian teachings, like God was once a man who was elevated to God. When no emphasis exists on truth and correct doctrine, doors like this are left wide open.</p>

<p>If people are taught to base their religious belief solely on emotional responses, how can they be  <em>”prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope”</em> found in the Gospel (1 Peter 3:15)?  The Apostles never appeared to anyone and discussed how they were made to feel by an encounter, but instead they boldly and firmly proclaimed the teachings of Jesus Christ and the revelations of the Prophets.</p>

<p>Even in the New Testament there were those who changed the teachings delivered by the Apostles and, as St. Paul taught, <em>”a little leaven leavens the whole loaf”</em> (Galatians 5:9). The Epistles of St. John were written in large part to encourage the faithful to remain steadfast in right doctrine and not to follow false teachers.</p>

<p>That’s why the New Testament warns us to, <em>”watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught,”</em> and not to <em>”be led away by diverse and strange teachings”</em> (Romans 16:17; Hebrews 13:9). Instead, we are encouraged to <em>”keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers”</em> 1 Timothy 4:16.</p>

<p>The successors to the Apostles took the teachings and traditions handed to them and passed them to their successors and preserved them. That’s the goal of a creed - to give the faithful within the community a set of boundaries of safe doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="after-all-christ-called-us-all-to-be-one-right">After all, Christ called us all to be one, right?</h2>
<p>In short, it’s not possible to truly be one with diverse teachings.  <em>”For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths”</em> (2 Timothy 4:3-4). The creeds give us formulas of doctrine that explain what we believe.</p>

<p>I like what the <em>Orthodoxy &amp; Heterodoxy</em> blog has to say on the matter, <em>”Theology is not just life and death, but _eternal</em> life and death. We have to get it right not just so we can belong to the right churchy club, but so we can grab hold of sanity in an insane world, so we can seek out the profound while surrounded by triviality, so we can pursue beauty in the midst of ugliness…Doctrine includes not just dogma, but every teaching and true tradition pertaining to union with the Holy Trinity—worship, asceticism, hierarchy, canonical tradition, and so forth. Doctrine is what we are taught and what we teach.”_  If we are not committed to getting that right, what are we committed to?</p>

<p>This is why we have creeds - to preserve the faith delivered once and for all - the faith handed to the Apostles by Christ and preserved unconquered by the Holy Spirit’s operation in the Church.</p>

<h2 id="the-nicene-creed">The Nicene Creed</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages, Light of Light, True God of True God, Begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made: Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;	And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;	And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets; And I believe in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the Resurrection of the dead, And the Life of the age to come. Amen.</p>

    <h2 id="its-just-a-christmas-song">It’s Just a Christmas Song</h2>

<p>I’ve had a few conversations with people this year about the song <em>”Mary Did You Know?”</em>  and it’s been interesting to hear how others feel about the song.  I’ve never really been a fan, namely because of how overly sentimental it feels to me, but this year I gave some thought to the meaning behind the song.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-it">So What’s Wrong With It?</h2>

<p>Okay, I’m not going to throw everything out and say that some how Mary knew each and every thing that would happen throughout Christ’s life. When songwriter Mark Lowry asks if Mary knew <em>”that your Baby Boy would one day walk on water?”</em> or <em>“that your Baby Boy will give sight to a blind man?”</em> or <em>”that your Baby Boy will calm the storm with His hand?”</em>, that’s valid theological speculation. We don’t really know if Mary knew those things. She could have been prophetic and foresaw some of those miracles that Christ would perform or maybe not, we’ll never know. But we do know that Mary had knowledge of the great power that Christ possessed as witnessed in the Gospel story of the wedding feast at Cana. When they ran out of wine for the feast, it was Mary who went to Christ to turn the water into wine.</p>

<p>Those questions aside, I do take issue with some of the other questions that songwriter Mark Lowry asks. Questions like, <em>“did you know that your Baby Boy would save our sons and daughters?”</em>, <em>“did you know that your Baby Boy has walked where angels trod? When you kiss your little Baby you kissed the face of God?”</em> These questions are outside the bound of theological speculation and land straight into a bad understanding of who Mary is and her relationship to God and her son.</p>

<p>Let’s just look at what the Archangel Gabriel told her whom he called full of Grace and pronounced the Lord was with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Luke 1:30-33.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabriel made it pretty clear who Jesus was to anyone knowledgable of the Scriptures. Since Mary was a faithful Israelite who had been taught the writings of the prophets, Mary knew what the angel meant. And these weren’t things she forgot. The nativity story in Luke tells us that <em>“Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart”</em> Luke 2:19. At Christ’s birth and as He grew, she knew He was God.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care?</h2>

<p>Mary is a saint I hold near and dear to my heart. As a young Evangelical, I dismissed the Mother of God and outright attacked her. To me, she was just another woman, nothing special, just an instrument of God. He could have chosen anyone. That’s not the whole story. Mary is a normal person, just like you and me, but she’s also so much more. She’s is extraordinary; despite the fact God <em>could</em> have chosen anyone, He didn’t - He chose Mary. She devoted herself fully to God, remained faithful to Him and gave her only son up to be crucified before her very eyes. As an aside here, I’ll make note that Mary was more faithful than 10 of the disiciples who had fled in fear from the crucifixion. She was the first Christian as she literally accepted Christ into her body. She was faithful when all hope seemed lost. She serves as an example of what faith in Christ should look like.</p>

<p>What we teach about Mary is also direct reflection of what we teach about Christ. When we call Mary the <em>Theotokos</em> (God-bearer or Mother of God), we are calling her that because Christ is both fully God and fully man. She gave birth to God through the Incarnation. We call Mary the second Eve because, just as Eve chose to sin and thus ushered death into the world, Mary said yes at the Annunciation and brought forth life into the world. We call Mary <em>“more spacious than the Heavens”</em> because she contained the God who all of creation could not contain within her womb. Just as she did during her life, everything about Mary continues to point to Christ, to call us to her Son.</p>

<p>When we diminish Mary, who she is or her knowledge of what she agreed to, we begin to diminish who Christ is. Without a doubt, Mary knew she kissed the face of God, she knew who Christ was and what His birth meant, both for her and for all of humanity.</p>

<p>With that, I join the angel and St. Elizabeth in singing,  “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.”</p>

    <p>Christmas is an exciting time and it is so easy to lose focus on why we’re celebrating.</p>

<p>Things are changing, the hot days of summer are gone and people have started pulling out the sweaters and coats, more so this year than most thanks to the polar vortex that brought some lovely snow to us here in Tulsa this weekend. This weather was perfectly timed with the start of the Fast of the Nativity to get me to thinking about Christmastime and how we as Orthodox Christians engage during this time year.</p>

<p>Growing up, Christmas was my favorite time of the year. The holiday was a really BIG event in our evangelical/charismatic church. We would do a candle light service every year where we would sing hymns. This felt Christmassy to me. Then when I was in high school, I attended a candle light mass at a Catholic church with a friend and that was pretty cool too. The churches were all decorated with greenery, big nativity scenes and we had the carols. I associated all ofthese things and songs with Christmas. When I became Orthodox, I really missed the way I had celebrated Christmas growing up a lot of that and really thought out how to reconcile that celebration with my new-found Orthodox celebration.Thirteen Christmases later, I have a few thoughts on this for others who have joined the Church or are looking into it. While this was originally meant to be a single blog post, like so many other times in my life, I found myself adding more and more and more, so this week I’m going to focus on Advent and Christmas music with more to come next week.this will be continued into next week.</p>

<h2 id="advent--the-nativity-fast">Advent – the Nativity Fast</h2>
<p>Our fast in the East begins on November 15th. I personally need the fast to help me stay focused on exactly what we are preparing to celebrate. The world around us is in a frenzied state of hyped up consumerism and unchecked revelry. Even many Christians in the West forget the purpose of the season leading up to Christmas. As everyone else is spinning out of control, the fast reminds us that we need to slow down and focus on Christ. The Incarnation, God becoming man, is an universe-altering event, that we need to really stop and reflect upon. As Orthodox Christians, we fast to bring us closer to God, not because we have to,for show or to create unfair hardship. Saint Cosmas of Aitolia instructs, “Fast according to your ability, pray according to your ability, give alms according to your ability.”</p>

<h3 id="what-better-time-than-nativity">What better time than Nativity?</h3>

<p>An important part of any fast is participation in the liturgical life of the Church. We have rich hymnography and services throughout Advent. To keep everything in focus, the church gives us hymn lyrics like this: “Make ready, O Bethlehem: let the manger be prepared, let the cave show it’s welcome. The truth has come, the shadow has passed away; born of a Virgin, God has appeared to men, formed as we are and making god-like the garment He has put on. Therefore Adam is renewed with Eve, and they call out: ‘Thy good pleasure has appeared on earth to save our kind.’” It is during this time that we remember Israel awaiting the arrival of the Christ child that we know is coming in a few weeks, so that when we arrive at the great Feast, we can sing as St. Symeon the God-receiver, “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.” Why does this matter? St. Maximos the Greek (4th century, not to be confused with St. Maximos the Confessor) wrote, “Unless the Lord comes to us, we are completely helpless.” Without the Incarnation, without the birth of Christ, we would not have the door to salvation that has been opened to us through His glorious Resurrection.</p>

<h2 id="christmas-music">Christmas Music</h2>

<p>I love Christmas music. I really do. Like, really really love Christmas music. It was always something that was a big deal to listen to in my home growing up and the songs were always a part of church life as well, one of the few vestiges of a liturgical life left in the religious tradition in which I grew up. Over the years, I’ve listened to Western Christmas hymns and studied them to ensure what I was hearing and singing was aligned with Orthodoxy. For the most part, I was really glad to learn that they were. I’m not talking the Jingle Bells or Rudolph or Christmas Shoes songs, I’m talking the O Come, O Come Emmanuel, Angels We Have Heard on High,  God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen songs. These are amazing. O Come, O Come Emmanuel recalls the need Israel had for a savior, the need all of humanity had for Christ. O Come All Ye Faithful calls the faithful to celebrate the birth of Christ together. Away in a Manager recalls Christ’s birth (though I’d like the cave to be mentioned somewhere in there). The Little Drummer Boy gives us images of finding the Christ child in the manager. We Three Kings recalls the journey of the Magi, Kings from the East, coming to worship the Heavenly King humbled as a young babe. Others like The First Noel, Good King Wenceslas, I Saw Three Ships, Joy to the World, and O Little Town of Bethlehem are great songs to listen to and sing during the Nativity Fast as they continue to point us to Christ and the real reason for the season.</p>

<p>Others I learned to be leary of. It Came Upon a Midnight Clear was written by a Unitarian with the intent of removing the Incarnational reality from Christ’s birth and Christmas. Unitarians are quick to point out that “the Christ-child is never mentioned” because it is “ethical song, extolling the worth and splendor of peace among men.”</p>

<p>That being said, it’s so important to incorporate the beauty of the Orthodox hymnography into Christmas celebrations. I’d venture to say, it’s not possible for one to keep Christ in Christmas more than the Orthodox Church has. If you want to hear some good Orthodox Christmas music, check out the CD Make Ready, O Bethlehem by Anaphora. I can’t really let you hear it here, so I’ll just share some of the beautiful poetry in our Christmas tradition:</p>

<p><em>Christ is born! Glorify Him!
Christ descends from the heavens, welcome Him!
Christ is now on earth, O be jubilant!
Sing to the Lord, the whole earth,
And sing praises to Him with joy, O ye people,
For He has been exalted!</em></p>

<p><em>What shall we present unto Thee, O Christ,
For Thy coming to earth for us men?
Each of Thy creatures brings Thee a thank-offering:
The angels — singing; the heavens — a star;
The Wise Men — treasures; the shepherds devotion;
The earth — a cave; the desert — a manger;
But we offer Thee the Virgin-Mother. O Eternal God, have mercy upon us.</em></p>

<p>“Today doth Bethlehem receive Him
Who sitteth with the Father for ever”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I behold a strange but very glorious mystery:
Heaven — the cave;
The throne of the Cherubim — the Virgin.
The manger — the receptacle in which Christ our God,
Whom nothing can contain, is lying*</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Thy Nativity, O Christ our God,
Has illumined the world like the Light of Wisdom</em></p>

<p><em>… They who worshipped the stars were through a star,
Taught to worship Thee, the Sun of Righteousness,
And to know Thee, the Day-Spring from on high</em></p>

    <h2 id="a-few-thoughts-on-the-international-refugee-crisis">A Few Thoughts on the International Refugee Crisis</h2>

<p>It’s that time a year that Christmas trees and decorations adorn shop windows, Christmas songs are playing, and people everywhere are beginning the hustle and bustle of preparing for the holiday season. At the same time, I see signs around that say <strong>“Keep Christ in Christmas.”</strong> While I don’t disagree with this sentiment I find these words to be especially hollow this year and feel a little like Charlie Brown (see the header image?).</p>

<p>Watching the news, I saw a list of states that have all made an effort to ban refugees from the Middle East. And you know what caught my eye about many of these states? They are the ones that have elected officials who identify themselves as Christians. For those of you who don’t know, I’m in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the buckle of the Bible belt. Our governor professes to be a Christian as do a majority of voters in our state, yet we are trying to refuse refugees fleeing from a land torn by violence at the hands of terrorists.</p>

<p>When the angels greeted the shepherds in the fields, they proclaimed a message that Christians sing every Christmas, <em>“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</em> Are we living that good will in our lives, especially offering good will to some of the most vulnerable people, when we are turning a blind eye to our brothers and sisters in their suffering and time of need?</p>

<p>Lest we forget, Christ our Lord was a refugee. The Apostle and Evangelist Matthew tells us that after Christ was born, his mother and Joseph had to flee from Israel and make a new home in a strange land because the tyrant Herod was slaughtering innocents throughout Israel. Even after they were told they could return to Israel, they weren’t able to go home but instead made a new home in Nazareth (Matthew 2:13-23). As Christians, we are known by our love for one another and closing ourselves off from those in need is not a sign of love (John 13:35).</p>

<p>Many of these refugees are fleeing from Syria right now and several of those are our brothers and sisters in Christ. Syria was a cradle of Christian civilization in the Early Church. St. Paul had his conversion on the road to Damascus, which is in present day Syria. Christians were first called Christians in Antioch which sits on the boarder with Syria and is where St. Paul and St. Barnabas began their missionary journey. Christians in Maaloula still speak Aramaic, the language of Christ. Believers have lived in this region since the time of Christ. As I read about the sister diocese to my diocese in Bosra-Hauran in Syria, my heart breaks. The Christian population has been decimated in Syria from those fleeing the violence, abductions and enslavement of Christians at the hands of terrorist groups from within their own country. We are talking up to 2 million Christians who are suffering right now. Those are just the Christians, not counting the others caught in the middle of this conflict.</p>

<p>As we remember what happened last week, the violent attacks by a terrorist groups in Paris, it seems our media has overlooked the violence in Beirut. I’d encourage everyone to read <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elio.nicolas1/posts/1115113775167118?fref=nf&amp;pnref=story">this post</a> for some insight into those events.</p>

<p>The reaction we’re seeing within our own country and I’m reading from Christians is not one in keeping with the teachings of Christ. Let’s remember what Christ told the righteous in Matthew  35:40:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of watching the news and reading articles about what companies aren’t saying, <em>“Merry Christmas,”</em> or building a defense against the <em>“War on Christmas”</em> let us watch our hearts and look at how we’re treating others who are in need, our brothers and sisters who are enduring through something so unimaginably horrific.</p>

<p>Let us also remember the words that grace the Statue of Liberty: <em>“give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.”</em> These are the people we are saying aren’t welcome here. If we are going to turn our heads and ignore the huddled masses yearning for freedom, we might as well take down Lady Liberty since she holds her lamp as a beacon. Taking Christianity out of the discussion, serving as a refuge is a part of our country, the reason for the founders of our country to come to our shores.</p>

<p>As we all make our preparations for Christmas, filling out cards, buying gifts, visiting friends and families, let us not forget what the Lord has called us to do. Let us not close our borders to those in need. Let us be vigilant and watchful for the will of the Lord so that when Christ returns, he will find us ready, like the wise virgins with their oil and the doors to the feast will not be closed to us.</p>

<p>I’m going to leave off with this beautiful prayer that I will be adding to my prayer rule during this Advent/Nativity season:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Jesus Christ, our God, You said to Your disciples, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.”  We come before You in humility and ask that Your peace which surpasses all understanding will descend upon all people around the world, especially those currently in conflict and at war. Increase understanding and forgiveness between nations.  Awaken the longing for a peaceful life in all those who are filled with hatred for their neighbor.  Extinguish every dispute and banish all temptations to disagreement. Grant wisdom to civil authorities.  Free those held captive, protect those in danger, and comfort those who are suffering and displaced.  Implant in all of us reverence for You, and confirm us in love for one another.  Make us worthy to celebrate the feast of Your holy nativity and to join with the angels in chanting: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men.” For You are the King of Peace and the Savior of our souls and to You we give glory together with Your eternal Father and Your most-holy, gracious and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen</p>
</blockquote>

    <h2 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure</h2>
<p>)I’ve wanted to write a listicle about the Orthodox Church, my home within Christianity, for quite some time. But, as often happens, I got distracted and never finished it, until today. So what changed? I saw an <a href="http://benirwin.me/2015/01/22/11-things-about-the-episcopal-church/">article</a> shared by my friend <a href="http://audreyeclectic.blogspot.com/">Heather</a> about the 11 things someone loves about the Episcopal Church. It inspired me to write this, not as a rebuttal or anything like that, but to share some of what in Orthodoxy keeps me connected to Christ, to the Church and to my brothers and sisters in Christ. That being said, thank you Ben and Heather for the inspiration and I hope I can do justice to the beauty of Orthodoxy._</p>

<h2 id="my-journey-to-orthodoxy">My Journey to Orthodoxy</h2>

<p>I joined the Orthodox Church almost 14 years ago after feeling lost within the Charismatic/Evangelical world. I was attending Oral Roberts University and had way too many questions to know where to even start. I had begun studying some Church History and was at a point where I was torn between Catholicism and Anglicanism, not feeling terribly comfortable with either option and my roommate was considering Messianic Judaism. The two of us were longing for something we couldn’t find and got to a point where we got a $1 loaf of french bread and bottle of grape juice to have communion in our room because we didn’t really know where we belonged.</p>

<p>Then one night, I was in someone’s dorm and saw a copy of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Eastern_Orthodox_Christianity.html?id=2B8lAQAAIAAJ">Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective</a> on his table. While I don’t recommend the book, it was enough to get me asking what Orthodox was. I did some research online, ordered a ton of books, and got everything I could from the library. The more I read, the more I felt at peace about things I’d been questioning. I prayerfully read, started attending <a href="http://www.stanontytulsa.com">my parish</a> here in town and was chrismated into the Church and I’ve never looked back. Here’s why:</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-to-figure-it-all-out">1. I don’t have to figure it all out.</h2>

<p>On Sunday mornings, when Fr. George begins to preach his homily, I listen and take what he teaches as spiritual food and edification. I do the same thing no matter which parish I visit because priests are connected to the Apostolic Tradition. They don’t spend time trying to think up new doctrine or theological opinions, because they participate in the continuation of the preaching and teaching (the kyrgma) of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Over the past 2,000 years, there have been countless heresy that have popped up around the world and tried to make in roads into the Church. Those heresies haven’t disappeared, but keep reemerging from various groups and some of them sound appealing. Without keeping constant vigil, it’s easy for one to begin to lean on one’s understanding or get carried off on a tangent that pulls away from the faith once delivered.</p>

<p>I’ve heard so many of my friends talk about how they didn’t agree with this pastor or that speaker and I remember the days in college when guest speakers would come and I became so skeptical that I was always waiting for an ax to drop. Some people I’ve talked to have said that’s just the way it is and sometimes their pastor or a speaker says great things and sometimes it’s “Biblically unsound.” Christ warned about false teachers, St. Paul warns against teachers who talk about things contrary to what has been taught and speculating in 1 Timothy, St. John warns about false teachers…the list could go on and on.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the Church has guarded the Truth and stands as the <em>”pillar and buttress of the truth”</em> (1 Timothy 3:15). The Church has held councils as the Apostles did in Acts 15 and was led by the guidance and protection of the Holy Spirit as Christ had promised.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy--orthopraxis-go-hand-in-hand">2. Orthodoxy &amp; Orthopraxis go hand in hand.</h2>

<p>Orthodoxy has maintained, over the centuries, that it is the responsibility of the Church to preserve doctrine. Our very name is rooted in that tradition - <em>ortho</em> meaning right or correct and <em>doxa</em> meaning belief. <strong>Most</strong> Christian traditions and sects have a concept of Christian belief, but what is missing is the idea of Christian Practice, or that there is even a concept of right practice. In Orthodoxy, the two are inseparable, but throughout much of the West this is a foreign idea. There is no hesitation or question of understanding when someone says that he or she is an Observant Jew, but there exists very little concept of an Observant Christian.</p>

<p>Our faith is put into practice in our doctrine and in our lives. The two are not mutually exclusive but built upon one another. As St. James tells us, we are “justified by works and not by faith alone” because “faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (2:24; 17).</p>

<p>So what does that look like? Within the Church, we <em>“stand firm and hold to the traditions</em>” that were delivered by the Apostles, <em>”either by spoken word or by our letter”</em> (2 Thessalonians 2:15). We are baptized for the remission of sins, receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, when we gather on the Lord’s Day, we participate in the Eucharist, we recieve the gift of confession, we celebrate together, we fast together, we mourn together…we work as one body of Christ.</p>

<p>In our every day lives, we are called to holiness, which we often miss. My praxis is challenged when I stand before the icon of Christ and confess our sins to Him in the presence of my priest and spiritual father who councils me and confirms God’s forgiveness.</p>

<h2 id="we-worship-with-our-whole-being">3. We worship with our whole being.</h2>

<p>Orthodox worship engages all of the senses, taking worship out of a theoretical place, and grounding it here, in something tangible. We cross ourselves, offer metenias, prostrate, process - all forms of worship involving movement, engaging our bodies. As we look around, we are surrounded by the icons of Christ and His saints, we hear the chanting and the bells, we smell the incense, we taste the fountain of immortality in the Eucharist - our whole person is engaged in worship, as it should be because, after all, when God created us He said, “It is good.”</p>

<p>Our senses being engaged in worship speaks to our view of humankind - we are not evil. Our bodies are not evil. We weren’t created to die, the separation of body and soul is a consequence of the fall, not part of God’s design. Our free will separates us, but it was Christ’s incarnation, a good and loving Christ who put on humanity, that redeemed the material world.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-is-connected">4. Orthodoxy is connected.</h2>

<p>When I go to an Orthodox Church, I know what to expect. Every Orthodox Church, throughout the entire world will be participating in the same liturgy I am. I am part of something much larger, part of communities of people I’ve never met with languages and cultural customs I know nothing about. A few years ago, I visited a Serbian parish that was near my parents. I <em>should</em> have done my research, but I didn’t and when I got there the entire liturgy was in Serbian. Despite the fact that I obviously don’t understand more than a couple of Serbian words, I was actively involed in the liturgy. I knew what the priest was saying, I knew what the chanters were chanting and I was able to participate in this glorious service, commune and fellowship with my brothers and sisters in Christ after service.</p>

<p>But the connection is deeper - as I look at the icons on the walls, I am connected with those saints. I am praying the same prayers they prayed, I am singing the same hymns they sang, I am receiving the same Eucharist they received. We are connected as the Church militant in a very real way to the Church invisible because,  <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews+12/">“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-dont-begin-or-end-liturgy-we-merely-join-in">5. We don’t begin or end liturgy, we merely join in.</h2>

<p>The Bible shows us insights into Heaven. In Isaiah, Daniel and St. John’s Apocolypse we see liturgical clothing, prayers and responses, censors and incense, lamps and lamp stands, candles, etc. There is an eternal liturgy taking place before the throne of God with angels and saints crying out to God. When we go to church, our services don’t begin and end, but we join into the prayers of the saints. We can again boldly confess that <em>“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses”</em>.</p>

<p>Recently we celebrated the Feast of All Saints. During Vespers we read, <em>“As is meet let us acclaim with sacred songs and laudations the divine assembly of the Apostles, Martyrs, and godly-minded priests, and the women most chaste, who throughout the whole world have contested in unshaken faith. For, though they were of earth, they were all united together with the Bodiless of Heaven’s heights, and by their august passion they received most blessed dispassion through Christ God’s grace. And now like steadfast stars that shine upon us, they intercede * with great boldness for our souls.”</em> It is a beautiful feast that reminds us that the Church militant is not removed from the Church invisible, we share the same Great High Priest in Christ Jesus, the same joy in the hope of the resurrection, and the same prayers for the world and all of humanity.</p>

<h2 id="orthodoxy-embraces-mystery">6. Orthodoxy embraces Mystery.</h2>

<p>As an Orthodox Christian, I don’t have to try to explain everything. I know that God is bigger than I am and that my ways truly are not His ways. I know that at some point this saying has become a cliche in the West and, as my friend Jeff Huston pointed out, if you would have asked either of us in our pre-Orthodox days if we believed that, we would have said yes without question.</p>

<p>Now that we’re Orthodox, it means something…more. In Orthodoxy, we don’t spend our time reading and studying, trying to find a dogmatic reason for things. We don’t have to explain everything, but leave it to mystery. Take the Eucharist for example. We don’t have a doctrine of Transubstantiation or try to explain how the bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ; we know this to be true and it happens by some Divine Mystery.  As a matter of fact, what are called Sacraments in the West are called Mysteries in the East!</p>

<p>When I was working on my graduate studies, we spent a great deal of time reading about the unknowability of God. There’s an apophatic approach to describing God. Any terms or attributes that we can ascribe to God are limited and fall short, so we describe what God isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-and-individual-worship-is-a-part-of-the-christian-life">7. Corporate and individual worship is a part of the Christian life.</h2>
<p>I’ve heard so many people place emphasis on worship and devotion to God being an individual act and, to a degree, I can get on board. I pray to God, I read the Scriptures and writings of the Church Fathers, and try to sit in the stillness seeking God as all Orthodox Christians are called to do.</p>

<p>When we go to church, all of our Orthodox Churches are all laid out the same - we walk into the narthex, enter into the nave and face the altar. The nave is like a ship carrying us all on the journey of life and faith towards Heaven. We participate in the Liturgy together, which, as its very name implies is the work of the people. We are saved both individually and as a community.</p>

<h2 id="confession-is-freeing">8. Confession is freeing.</h2>
<p>I have a spiritual father, not just a priest, but someone who knows me inside and out, all of my deepest darkest secrets who helps me navigate through the Christian life. After I’ve prayerfully prepared for Confession, I go to our parish and stand with my priest before the icon of Christ at the front of our parish. As I confess, I make my confession to Christ and sometimes I’m granted the freeing tears of repentance. Once I’ve finished, Fr. George confirms Christ’s forgiveness and the remission of sins. But that’s not all, he counsels me with spiritual wisdom that helps me grow in Christ. The Church, through confession, helps us to rise up and become who we are supposed to be in Christ. We are conformed to the image and likeness of Christ. After I confess, I feel free. The sins that I’ve committed, both out in the open and those that I think have been done in secret, once confessed, lose their hold on me. I no longer feel the weight of guilt, but instead know that I can be more than who I am.</p>

<p>Not only is it freeing, it is Biblical. One of Christ’s final things Christ bestowed to His Disciples was the authority to forgive sins in Heaven and on earth. We believe the Bible to be inspired and have faith in the work of Christ. That authority to confirm the remission of sins is a great gift that far too many people have thrown aside.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgical-calendar-is-a-calendar-for-our-lives">9. The liturgical calendar is a calendar for our lives.</h2>
<p>I always loved Christmas - the decorations, the Christmas music we sang in Church, the reading of the Nativity story. Now I love the rest of the events in Christ’s life, along with the events of the Early Church as well lives of the Theotokos and saints and major events in the life of the Church throughout history. The Israelites remembered important days in which God intervened and helped them as Feast Days, days Christ and the Apostles kept.</p>

<p>We celebrated Pascha (Easter) a few months ago, and every day we were reminded that we are in the Paschal season. During the Paschal Season, I find myself singing the Paschal troparion - <em>Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!</em> - and the Paschal antiphons, I greet other members of the Church by saying <strong><em>“Christ is Risen”</em></strong>, and look forward to seeing the Paschal candle every week at Church. After 40 days, we celebrated the Ascension, followed by Pentecost in another 10 days. August 6th is Transfiguration, the Church New Year is September 1st, the Nativity of the Theotokos follows on September 8th, then the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross on September 14th…you get the idea. Plus we celebrate our family members’ (and friends’) patron saint days (or, as we call them, name days). Our year revolves around the Church year. We fast, feast and celebrate together. We have customs and traditions in our parish and at our home. It brings our life in Christ and the life of the Church into our every day in a whole new, yet ancient, way.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-conforms-us-we-dont-conform-it">10. The Church conforms us, we don’t conform it.</h2>

<p>During the Civil Rights march in Selma, Archbishop Iakavos marched and stood next to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights movement didn’t alter the Church or change the Church, but the Civil Rights movement was rooted in the unchanging truths evident within the Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy doesn’t change every few decades depending on how society changes, but remains a true and steady witness to Christ throughout history.</p>

<p>We are called to holiness and the standard or measure of holiness is not something that is subjective or something that changes day to day. As things change or public opinion falters, the Church doesn’t change. Instead, we are called to change, as it should be. There is an idea today that we hold God to humanly standards and conform Him to our own image or ideals - instead we are still in a world in which we are ever changed and molded into God’s image.</p>

<h2 id="the-liturgy-becomes-a-part-of-you">11. The liturgy becomes a part of you.</h2>

<p>I never would have believed it at the time, but looking back, I can see that the churches I grew up in had their own liturgy. You go to church, there was upbeat fun music, it would slow down, the pastor would preach for 40 minutes, the lights would go down and slow music would start playing. It happened every week. While at ORU, I learned that there were formulas for this.</p>

<p>Within Orthodoxy, the liturgy we use is tried and true - most Sundays we pray the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a liturgy that has been used by the Church since the 4th century!</p>

<p>Liturgy guides us, it serves as a beacon in a storm-tossed world  that ensures we are oriented in the right direction and keeps our focus aimed for the Kingdom of God, not just some far off place, but helps us find the Kingdom that is within us.</p>

<h2 id="the-church-knows-what-we-need-when-we-dont">12. The Church knows what we need when we don’t.</h2>

<p>Last week, a good friend of mine, our parish chanter, fell in asleep in the Lord. It was fairly sudden and caught me by surprise. While he was in the hospital, on life support, and I went to Vespers for All Saints. The readings were so aptly timed - (Isaiah 43:9-14, Wisdom of Solomon 3:1-9 &amp; Wisdom of Solomon 5:15-6:3). It was comforting to hear the encouragement about the saints. After that, I went with my priest when he prayed the prayers for the departing of the soul from the body. It was emotional and I was lost. I didn’t know what to think, much less what to pray. He fell asleep later that evening. Then when I was at home, I was able to turn to the prayers of the Church which gave me comfort. Then, the following morning, we held a prayer service (Trisagian) for him. The Church was there to give us what we needed.</p>

<p>The same is true of things like fasting. A mother gives her child the medicine he or she needs. I think we can all remember a time from childhood when we were sick and our mom gave us something that didn’t taste very good, but, in the end, it made us better.  The same is true for the Church. When I started in a prescribed fast, it was odd. At first, it was a challenge to overcome, I guess you could say I gamified fasting - if I do this, this, and this I win fasting. Then it was something I didn’t do for a long time or I would look for loopholes around fasting. But, when I started fasting, as tough as it was, it began to make sense. I had to put in the effort that the Church prescribed before I could understand the richness that is set there for usx by Christ.</p>

<p>The same is true of so many aspects of our lives - our services, our readings, our icons, confession, fasting, the lives of the saints - I could go on and on. The Church, as the body of Christ, is the great hospital for us on earth and is here to take care of us, even if we don’t know what we need.</p>

<p>I know some of these things may not sound earth shattering, but believe me they are. Something is different within Orthodoxy, it’s healing, it helps us to become whole, it continues the work of Christ in restoring humanity through the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
