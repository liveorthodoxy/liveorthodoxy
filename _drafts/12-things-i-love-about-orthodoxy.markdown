## Full Disclosure
*I've wanted to write a listicle about the Orthodox Church, my home within Christianity, for quite some time. But, as often happens, I got distracted and never finished it, until today. So what changed? I saw an [article](http://benirwin.me/2015/01/22/11-things-about-the-episcopal-church/) shared by my friend [Heather](http://audreyeclectic.blogspot.com/) about the 11 things someone loves about the Episcopal Church. It inspired me to write this, not as a rebuttal or a "We're better than you," but to share some of what in Orthodoxy keeps me connected to Christ, to the Church and to my brothers and sisters in Christ. That being said, thank you Ben and Heather for the inspiration and I hope I can do justice to the beauty of Orthodoxy.*

## My Journey to Orthodoxy

I joined the Orthodox Church almost 14 years ago after feeling lost within the Charismatic/Evangelical world. I was attending Oral Roberts University and had way too many questions to know where to start. I had begun studying some Church History and was at a point where I was torn between Catholocism and Anglicanism, not feeling terribly comfortable with either option and my roommate was considering Messianic Judaism. The two of us were longing for something we couldn't find and got to a point when we got a $1 loaf of french bread and bottle of grape juice to have communion in our room because we didn't really know where we belonged.

Then one night, I was in someone's dorm and saw a copy of [Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective](http://books.google.com/books/about/Eastern_Orthodox_Christianity.html?id=2B8lAQAAIAAJ) on his table. While I don't recommend the book, it was enough to get me asking what Orthodox was. I did some research online, ordered a ton of books, and got everything I could from the library. The more I read, the more I felt at peace about things I'd been questioning. I prayerfully read, started attending [my parish](http://www.stanontytulsa.com) here in town and was chrismated into the Church and I've never looked back. Here's why:

## 1. I don't have to figure it all out.

On Sunday mornings, when Fr. George begins to preach his homily, I listen and take what he teaches as spiritual food and edification. I do the same thing no matter which parish I visit because priests are connected to the Apostolic Tradition. They don't spend time trying to think up new doctrine or theological opinions, because they participate in the continuation of the preaching and teaching (the kyrgma) of the Apostles. 

## 2. Orthodoxy & Orthopraxis go hand in hand

The holy apostles taught us to "hold fast to the traditions "

## 4. We worship with our whole being

Orthodox worship engages all of the senses, taking worship about of a theoretical place, and grounding it here, in something tangible. We cross ourselves, offer metenias, prostrate, process - all forms of worship involving movement, engaging our bodies. As we look around, we are surrounded by the icons of Christ and His saints, we hear the chanting and the bells, we smell the incense, we taste the fountain of immortality in the Eucharist - our whole person is engaged in worship, as it should be because, afterall, when God created us He said, "It is good." 

Our senses engaged in worship speaks to our view of humankind - we are not evil. Our bodies are not evil. We weren't created to die, the seperation of body and soul is a consequence of the fall, not part of God's design. Our free will seperates us, but it was Christ's incarnation, a good and loving Christ who put on humanity, that redeemed the material world.


## 5. Orthodoxy is connected

When I go to an Orthodox Church, I know what to expect. Every Orthodox Church, throughout the entire world will be participating in the same liturgy I am. I am part of something much larger, part of communities of people I've never met with languages and cultural customs I know nothing about. A few years ago, I visited a Serbian parish that was near my parents. I *should* have done my research, but I didn't and when I got there the entire liturgy was in Serbian. Despite the fact that I obviously don't understand more than a couple of Serbian words, I was actively involed in the liturgy. I knew what the priest was saying, I knew what the chanters were chanting and I was able to participate in this glorious service, commune and fellowship with my brothers and sisters in Christ after service.

But the connection is deeper - as I look at the icons on the walls, I am connected with those saints. I am praying the same prayers they prayed, I am singing the same hymns they sang, I am receiving the same Eucharist they received. We are connected as the Church militant in a very real way to the Church invisible because,  ["we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses" (Hebrews 12:1)](http://www.esvbible.org/Hebrews+12/).

## 6. We don't begin or end liturgy, we merely join in

The Bible shows us insights into Heaven. We see 

## 7. Orthodoxy embraces Mystery.
As an Orthodox Christian, I don't have to try to explain everything. I know that God is bigger than I am and that my ways truly are not His ways.

## 8. Corporate and Individual Worship is a part of the Christian life
Orthodox Churches are all laid out the same - we walk into the narthex, enter into the nave and face the altar. The nave is like a ship,

## 9. Confession is freeing.
I have a spiritual father, not just a priest, but someone who knows me inside and out, all of my deepest darkest secrets who helps me navigate through the Christian life. After I've prayerfully prepared for Confession, I go to our parish and stand with my priest before the icon of Christ at the front of our parish. As I confess, I make my confession to Christ and sometimes I'm granted the freeing tears of repentence. Once I've finished, Fr. George confirms Christ's forgiveness and the remission of sins. But that's not all, he counsels me with spiritual wisdom that helps me grow in Christ. The Church, through confession, helps us to rise up and become who we are supposed to be in Christ. We are conformed to the image and likeness of Christ. After I confess, I feel free. The sins that I've committed, both out in the open and those that I think have been done in secret, once confessed, lose their hold on me. I no longer feel the weight of guilt, but instead know that I can be more than who I am.

## 10. The Liturgcial Calendar 
I always loved Christmas - the decorations, the Christmas music we sang in Church, the reading of the Nativity story. Now I love the rest of the events in Christ's life, along with the events of the Early Church as well lives of the Theotokos and saints and major events in the life of the Church throughout history. The Israelites remembered important days in which God intervened and helped them as Feast Days, days Christ and the Apostles kept.

We just celebrated Pascha (Easter) a few weeks ago and every day, we remember that we are in the Paschal season: I find myself sing the Paschal troparion *Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!* and the Paschal antiphons, I greet other members of the Church by saying *"Christ is Risen"* and look forward to seeing the Paschal candle every week at Church. After 40 days, we'll celebrate the Ascension , followed by Pentecost in another 10 days. August 6th is Transfiguration, the Church New Year is September 1st, the Nativity of the Theotokos follows on September 8th, then the Feast of the Elevation of the Cross on September 14th...you get the idea. Plus we celebrate our family members' (and friends') patron saint days (or, as we call them, name days). Our year revolves around the Church year. We fast, feast and celebrate together. We have customs and traditions in our parish and at our home. It brings our life in Christ and the life of the Church into our every day in a whole new yet ancient way.

## 11. The Church conforms us, we don't conform it.

During the Civil Rights march in Selma, Archbishop Demetrius marched and stood next to Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights movement didn't altar the Church or change the Church, but the Civil Rights movement was rooted in unchanging truths evident within the Orthodox Church. Orthodoxy doesn't change every few decades depending on how society changes, but remains a true and steady witness to Christ throughout history. 


## 12. The liturgy becomes a part of you.

I never would have believed it at the time, but looking back, I can see that the churches I grew up in had their own liturgy. You go to church, there was upbeat fun music, it would slow down, the pastor would preached for 40 minutes, the lights would go down and slow music would start playing. It happened every week. While at ORU, I learned that there were formulas for this.

Within Orthodoxy, the liturgy we use is tried and true - most Sundays we pray the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a liturgy that has been used by the Church since the 4th century!
