## Compiling a List

This week at [Compose](https://https://compose.io/), our content writer [DJ](http://www.codepope.com) did a round-up of the tools our team uses. I thought it was a great idea, so I'm doing a quick round up of my favorite social tools:

[Moz](https://moz.com) is one of my favorite tools. I use it for work to help

[Buffer](https://www.buffer.com) offers the ability to manage multiple social media channels at once pretty easily and, if you have less than 5 platforms you're using, they have a free option. With Buffer, I write social posts and schedule them so that I can get something posted at the best time to reach the most people. It integrates with Moz's _Followerwonk_ which lets you look at your Twitter profile, see when your followers are most active and automatically import those times in to Buffer. After something goes out, Buffer's Analyitics gives you insights into how people are engaging with your posts so you can quickly see what is and what isn't working.

It's easy to tell on social media when someone tags you in a post so you can retweent, share or respond to it, but what about when people don't make it that easy? That's where [Mention](https://www.mention.com) comes in. Not only does mention monitor my social profiles, but I set alerts for certain terms and when those are posted, I get notified. I _usually_ keep Mention up for real-time monitoring, but if for some reason I miss something, I get email notifications. This helps make sure that nothing I'm monitoring goes unnoticed.

After I made the move to Markdown, I fell in love pretty quickly. I started using it for writing my blog and I use Markdown for work. To simplify the writing process (and elimenate distractions), I use [Ulysses](http://ulyssesapp.com/) for Mac. It's one of the more expensive apps I've purchesed at $49.99, but it's worth it. It creates a clean area to write with great Markdown support.
